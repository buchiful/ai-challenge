the rights to stream our live and recorded music and broadcasts from a combination of festival owners and promoters, such as Anschutz
Entertainment Group (&ldquo;AEG&rdquo;) and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (&ldquo;Live Nation&rdquo;), music labels, including Universal
Music, Warner Music and Sony Music, and through individual music publishers and rights holders. In March 2019, we entered into a multi-year
agreement with iHeartMedia that combines content, production, distribution and promotion, which was further extended in March 2020, giving
us exclusive global livestreaming rights to over 20 of their events per year. Beginning mid-March 2020, the current pandemic associated
with COVID-19 temporarily shut down the production of all on-ground, live music festivals and events. As a result, we pivoted our production
to 100% streaming, and began producing, curating, and broadcasting streaming music festivals, concerts and events across our platform.
In May 2020, we launched our first pay-per-view (&ldquo;PPV&rdquo;) performances across our platform, allowing artists and fans to access
a new digital compliment to live festivals, concerts and events.</P>

and events throughout the world and across any digital platform, including cable, Internet, video, audio, video-on-demand (&ldquo;VOD&rdquo;)
and virtual reality (&ldquo;VR&rdquo;). As of March 31, 2021, we held the streaming rights to over 26 festivals and live music events
under long-term contracts that range from two to seven years in duration. Today, we have increased these live streaming festival rights
and are working to expand our VOD, PPV, content catalog and content capabilities. Since 2018, we launched LiveZone, a traveling studio
originating from live music events and festivals all over the world. LiveZone combines music news, commentary, festival updates and artist
interviews, and provide context to premiere events by showcasing exotic locales, unique venues, and artist backstories, adding &ldquo;pre-show&rdquo;

music events and festivals at a variety of indoor clubs and outdoor venues and arenas (&ldquo;On-premise Live Events&rdquo;). These services
allow our users to access live music content in person and over the Internet, including the ability to chat and communicate over our platform.
LiveXLive provides Digital Live Events for free to our users; however, beginning in May 2020 we launched PPV capabilities and began charging
our users to view certain Digital Live Events. We monetize these live events through third party advertising and sponsorship, including
with brands such as Hyundai, Facebook, Tik Tok, Porsche, and Pepsi, and selling territorial licensing rights to Tencent in China and Ocesa
in Mexico. Our cost structure varies by music event, and may include set upfront fees/artist guarantees, the amount of which is often
dependent on specific artist. A festival&rsquo;s existing production infrastructure or lack thereof, and, in turn results in, us having
an production/financial commitment to the live stream, and in some cases, we may also share the associated revenue. The fees generated
from any advertising, sponsored content, VOD/PPV and other services are generally subject to the aforementioned revenue sharing arrangements
with certain artists, festival owners and/or music right holders, when applicable.</P>

billion in 2020, up 7.4%. We believe that by 2030, global recorded music revenues will increase to $45 billion. Our addressable market
includes streaming of live music and entertainment, Internet radio, audio downloadable music, podcasts and online VOD services. These
markets are experiencing significant growth and now represent the majority of the music industry&rsquo;s overall revenue, as physical
and digital record sales have steadily declined. We both capitalize on these trends and provide additional earnings opportunities to industry
stakeholders, including agents, managers, distributors, producers, labels, publishers, advertisers and social influencers (collectively,
&ldquo;Industry Stakeholders&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The live music industry is
a large, growing market that creates, manages and promotes live performances and events, ranging from festivals to concerts and events
in stadiums, arenas, and other smaller venues. In the U.S. alone, pre-COVID-19, we expect the live music industry to grow to over $17
billion of revenue annually in 2021, representing a +43% growth rate over 2020, and over $5.0 billion in live music sponsorship for the
same periods. Post-COVID-19, we expect live music industry revenues to grow to $30 billion by 2023. Festivals, which is where our live
concert promotion has focused on, have become an increasingly important cultural phenomenon. Each festival can attract hundreds of thousands
of people over multiple day periods. The most popular festivals based on attendance include Coachella, EDC, Glastonbury, Outside Lands
Music and Arts Festival, Rock Werchter, Rock in Rio, Roskilde, Tomorrowland and Ultra Music Festival. The live event industry is a global
market with only a fraction of the leading live music events located in the U.S. In addition to festivals, there are thousands of live
music events and performances that occur nightly in large and small venues such as arenas, theatres, clubs, bars and lounges. As a result
of the popularity of live music performances, there has been a growing interest in experiencing live events and performances via online
streaming distribution. To address this growing opportunity, we acquired React Presents in February 2020, which promoted, produced and
ran over 200 live events in 2019, including Spring Awakening, one of the largest music festivals in the Chicago, Illinois and drawing
a large regional audience.</P>

in early calendar year 2020, substantially all major live music events to be held in calendar year 2020 were cancelled, including our
own Spring Awakening. To address the demand for live music events, we shifted our focus to live digital concerts and festivals, and our
platform experienced tremendous growth in the number of live events streamed and overall viewership. During the fiscal year ended March
31, 2021, we live-streamed over 146 events with over 150 million views. These events featured artists such as Pitbull, Wiz Khalifa, Dierks
Bentley, Billie Eilish, and The Foo Fighters, in addition to our own internally developed franchises such as &ldquo;Music Lives,&rdquo;
our largest digital music event, &ldquo;Music Lives ON,&rdquo; our weekly series of virtual live-streaming performances, and &ldquo;The
Lockdown Awards,&rdquo; our award show celebrating the best in quarantine content. By comparison, we livestreamed 42 live festival and
events and generated over 69 million views for the entire fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.</P>

grows, the addressable market for podcast advertising spend continues to grow. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that podcast advertising

demand, thereby placing the most popular content closest to user endpoints, reducing latency and the number of content requests sent to
our data center. When a given user makes a play request from their mobile device, the web, connected car, etc., the system sets up a secure

respectively.</P>

Accordingly, our significant operating and deal-making experience and relationships with Content Providers, OEMs such as Tesla, cable

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our near-term strategy is
to continue aggressively producing, acquiring and aggregating live and on-demand performances (e.g., on stage sets) and non-performance
(e.g., behind the scenes, interviews) music-related video content from festivals, clubs, events, concerts, artists, promoters, venues,
music labels and publishers (collectively, the &ldquo;Content Providers&rdquo;); acquiring and producing original music-related video
and audio content; and curating existing online and digital radio premium content. In addition to acquiring and/or partnering with third
party Content Providers, our digital studio, LXL Studios, plans to develop and produce original music-related video content, including
digital magazine-style news programming and original-concept digital pilots and documentaries. During fiscal year ended March 31, 2021,
we also launched our own franchises including &ldquo;Music Lives,&rdquo; our annual multi-artist virtual festival, &ldquo;Music Lives
ON,&rdquo; our weekly series of virtual live-streaming performances, and &ldquo;The Lockdown Awards&rdquo;, our award show celebrating
the best in quarantine content.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Over the long term, our strategy
is to combine our live events with our audio music and radio services (collectively, the &ldquo;Music Services&rdquo;). We believe that
the combination of these Music Services will serve as our user engagement platform, differentiate our Music Services from our competitors
and provide us more opportunities to expand and grow our current subscriber base and revenues from subscription fees, advertising, sponsorship
and licensing. Moreover, we plan to drive more audience to our Music Services platform of as we grow our streamed live events, helping
us leverage and lower our overall marketing spending and drive more user growth.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Approximately 51% and 93%
of our revenue for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was from our subscription services platform. With the increase
in the number of digital-only live events and live views across our platform, we have experienced substantial growth in paid sponsorship
revenue. With the acquisition of PodcastOne, our advertising revenue substantially increased as an overall percentage of our total revenue
from 6% to 32%. Given the timing of the acquisition of CPS, merchandising revenue represented only 8% of our total revenues for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2021, however, we expect it to become a more meaningful portion of our overall revenue mix in fiscal 2022 and thereafter.
Also, as live events return post the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect ticket and event revenue (including sponsorship) to increase meaningfully
as a percentage of our overall revenue mix in the coming periods. We also believe the data we generate from our platform will be valuable
to Industry Stakeholders and the ability to reach our audience to market more efficiently to them products and services.</P>

is to build a compelling online and digital experience for our users, anchored by a pioneering website and our custom LXL App. Our LiveXLive
platform offers access to some of the world&rsquo;s leading music festivals and live events with multi-day and simultaneous multi-stage
coverage, unique concerts, intimate performances and premium original programming. It is fueled by our LXL App, which we believe will
drive 24/7/365 user engagement and data that we will be able to convert to earnings and cash flow through multiple potential revenue streams.</P>

develop our custom App with interactive features that enhance the live music experience and, when combined with our platform&rsquo;s functionality,
unique features and underlying music service, create an immersive digital experience in and of itself. We believe the combination of the
intuitive, modern LiveXLive user interface and cross-platform capabilities will be instrumental in creating a deeply engaging, personally-tailored
central hub for live music, music-related video content and streaming music content, particularly for those users who are otherwise unable
to attend live events in person. Our aim is to also include features for personalization, social interaction services, multiple live channels,
vertical video, merchandise and other offerings to further solidify users&rsquo; affinity toward our platform and their interests.</P>

a responsive HTML-based website that has been developed to work across browsers on any Internet-connected screen. The website&rsquo;s
home page includes featured content portals used for programming the most relevant content. The remainder of the page features video content
and music stations that are updated regularly and covers a full spectrum of music genres. As our content library and user data grows,
the featured content portals and other aspects of the user experience will be individually personalized and tailored to a user&rsquo;s
preferences and interests. We have added video, display and other advertising to the website to generate additional revenue. We will work
with our developers to continue to iterate, add and tweak features based on internal and external feedback.</P>

original content video, locally sold and programmatic ads capability, the capability to display time-shifted content and enhanced functionality
that will support social media sharing and user community engagement. The main Live page of our LXL App includes a top hero carousel depicting
featured performances and options for viewing concurrent programming located below the top carousel. Our LXL App also includes a Live
Video experience tab dedicated to ongoing and past festivals. For this section, we allow users to view multiple stages of a single festival
broadcasting live simultaneously when applicable. We believe this fun and simple interface layout, together with LiveZone, will highlight
key content and encourage users to also discover our other content offerings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><B>Artist Picker - Personalization
</B>&mdash; This feature is foundational for personalization and recommendations of content with user profile integration; artists that
are picked will track to user profiles for personalization. Through our acquisition of Slacker, we are able to add their highly developed
enterprise content and user management systems to the LiveXLive platform. Once they have been upgraded to work with video as well as audio,
they will form the core of LiveXLive&rsquo;s data management platform and personalization system.</P>

&mdash; With the unification convergence of two content services, this integration includes the Slacker music service for streaming radio
stations with data informed human curation. Slacker&rsquo;s expertise and toolset for generating both human curated and programmatically
generated media channels allow LiveXLive to quickly bring both audio and video channels to market for a fraction of the expense typically

Central to the consumption of live music online is the ability for the audience to interact with each other, our hosts and influencers,
and the artists themselves. We are building out the social features for our social community based around highly engaging, exclusive live
music festival broadcasts that will enable us to innovate our social engagement tools beyond the competition.</P>

Due to the growing demand for digital-only events post COVID-19, we created our own PPV platform, which allows artists, venues, promoters
and festivals to charge users direct for digital access to live events. We also expect our PPV platform to continue to grow substantially
in the long term and could represent a large mix of our revenue as early as fiscal year 2022. We continue to see growth in PPV post COVID-19
lockdowns being eased.</P>

live entertainment remains highly competitive, the digital distribution of live and music-related video content is still a nascent market.
We believe live streamed music video content is the only remaining media genre without a dominant brand. We believe there is a tremendous
amount of high-quality live music content available to be captured and produced but without a singular home for distribution and access
by the public at large.</P>

with other platforms and Content Providers that deliver content through Internet-connected screens.</P>

valuable distribution partners. For example, we have livestreamed our music festivals and events across Facebook, YouTube and Twitch,

In December 2017, we acquired Slacker Radio (&ldquo;Slacker&rdquo;) and substantially all of our revenues as of March 31, 2021 were generated
by Slacker, PodcastOne, and CPS. To date, we have devoted most of our financial resources to developing our current business model, growing

the online video streaming industry, companies have had no or limited success in operating a premium Internet network devoted to live
music and music-related video content. Because we have a limited operating history, we cannot assure you that our business will be profitable

and cash used in operating activities of $9.5 million and $4.9 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
As of March 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $169.9 million and net assets of $8.1 million. We anticipate incurring additional
losses until such time that we can generate significant increases to our revenues, and/or reduce our operating costs and losses. To date,
we have financed our operations exclusively through the sale of equity and/or debt securities (including convertible securities). The
size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to significantly grow our business
and increase our revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we grow our business. We also expect a
continued increase in our expenses associated with our operations as a publicly-traded company. We may incur significant losses in the
future for a number of other reasons, including unsuccessful acquisitions, costs of integrating new businesses, expenses, difficulties,
complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the
foreseeable future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.&nbsp;</P>

we have funded our business operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity and/or debt issuances (including convertible
securities). To support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our platform
and product offerings. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities
may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution.
Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other
financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.
Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, require additional restrictive financial and operational
covenants, or require us to incur significant transaction fees, issue warrants or other equity securities, or issue convertible securities.
These restrictions and covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand, or otherwise pursue our business
activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and
breaches of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default and an acceleration of our obligations under a debt agreement.
If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights
to our technologies or our solutions under development, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the
economic value of those programs to us.</P>

of coronavirus, COVID-19 in December 2019 subsequently became a global pandemic and its impact continues as of the date of this Annual
Report. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted parts of our business during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021,and continues to impact
such parts of our business as of the date of this Annual Report, namely our live events and programmatic advertising. We began to experience
modest adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and this impact became more
adverse and continued throughout the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and is expected to continue through at least the quarter ended June
30, 2021. Due to the global pandemic and government actions taking in response, since March 2020, all in person festivals, concerts and
events have either been canceled or suspended, and it is uncertain when they will be permitted to resume. With our acquisition of React
Presents in February 2020, we were unable to produce and promote more than 200 forecasted live events in fiscal year ended March 31, 2021
and as of the date of this Annual Report, including our flagship live event Spring Awakening festival which is typically annually produced
in June. Moreover, our programmatic advertising is presently adversely impacted as COVID-19 caused advertising demand to decline and as
a result, overall advertising cost per thousand impressions rates across our platform were subsequently reduced. Furthermore, as of the
date of this Annual Report, we are not livestreaming any fan attended live festivals, concerts or other in-person live events on our platform
or channels and it is unclear when streaming of fan attended live festivals, concerts or other in-person live events will again become
available to us. In addition, the outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that governments, other third parties or we may
take in respect of the coronavirus may result in a period of business disruption and reduced operations. For example, Tesla was ordered
to keep its main U.S. factory closed for a substantial amount of time in 2020 calendar year.</P>

side platforms and other platforms, such as Google AdSense, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, Oath advertising platform and Microsoft Media Network,
for marketing budgets and in the development of the tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. Slacker competes
with platforms, such as Apple&rsquo;s iTunes Music Store and Apple Music, Spotify, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, YouTube, Tidal, Napster and
Amazon Prime that provide interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment. In order to grow our revenues and improve
our operating results, we will need to increase our share of spending on advertising relative to our competitors, many of which are larger
companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially
broader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services to gain additional share of

digital advertising industry is introducing new ways to measure and price advertising inventory. For example, a significant portion of
advertisers are in the process of moving from purchasing advertisement impressions based on the number of advertisements served by the
applicable ad server to a new &ldquo;viewable&rdquo; impression standard (based on number of pixels in view and duration) for select products.
In the absence of a uniform industry standard, agencies and advertisers have adopted several different measurement methodologies and standards.
In addition, measurement services may require technological integrations, which are still being evaluated by the advertising industry
without an agreed-upon industry standard metric. As these trends in the industry continue to evolve, our advertising revenue may be adversely
affected by the availability, accuracy, and utility of the available analytics and measurement technologies as well as our ability to
successfully implement and operationalize such technologies and standards.</P>

technologies are currently more developed in terms of advertising technology and industry adoption on the web than they are on mobile

of our ad-supported user hours occur on mobile devices, if we are unable to deploy effective solutions to monetize the mobile device usage
by our&nbsp;ad-supported&nbsp;user base, our ability to attract advertising spend, and ultimately our advertising revenue, may be adversely

&ldquo;open Internet rules&rdquo; prohibited mobile providers in the United States from impeding access to most content, or otherwise
unfairly discriminating against Content Providers like us. These rules also prohibited mobile providers from entering into arrangements
with specific Content Providers for faster or better access over their data networks. However, on December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to
repeal the &ldquo;open Internet rules&rdquo; and as a result, broadband services are now subject to less U.S. federal regulation. A number
of parties have already stated they would appeal this order, and it is possible United States Congress may adopt legislation restoring
some of the &ldquo;open Internet rules.&rdquo; If, as a result of the repeal of &ldquo;open Internet rules,&rdquo; broadband providers
in the United States decrease access to certain content, start entering into arrangements with specific Content Providers for faster or
better access over their data networks, or otherwise unfairly discriminate against Content Providers like us, this could increase our
cost of doing business and put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to larger competitors. Additionally, mobile providers may be
able to limit our users&rsquo; ability to access our platforms or make them a less attractive alternative to our competitors&rsquo; applications.

have in the past been, and continue to be, impacted by attempts by third parties to artificially manipulate stream counts. Such attempts
may, for example, be designed to influence placement of content on Slacker-created playlists or industry music charts. These potentially
fraudulent streams also may involve the creation of&nbsp;non-bona&nbsp;fide user accounts or artists. For example, an individual might
generate fake users to stream songs repeatedly, thereby generating revenue each time the song is streamed, or might utilize fake users
to stream specific content to increase its visibility on our or third-party charts. We use a combination of algorithms and manual review
by employees to detect fraudulent streams. However, we may not be successful in detecting, removing and addressing all fraudulent streams
(and any related user accounts). If in the future we fail to successfully detect, remove and address fraudulent streams and associated
user accounts, it may result in the manipulation of our data, including the key performance indicators which underlie, among other things,
our contractual obligations with advertisers (which could expose us to the risk of litigation), as well as harm our relationships with
advertisers and rights holders. In addition, once we detect, correct and disclose fraudulent streams and associated user accounts and
the key performance indicators they affect, investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators could be undermined.
These could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.</P>

are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent

the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these

proceeds of less than $2.0 million from a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (the &ldquo;PPP&rdquo;) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and Economic Security Act (&ldquo;CARES Act&rdquo;), which was subsequently forgiven in April 2021. On March 20, 2021, we received proceeds
of $0.6 million from a second loan (&ldquo;the PPP loan&rdquo;) under the PPP of the CARES Act, which we intend to use to retain employees
and for other qualifying expenses. The PPP Loan matures on March 20, 2026 and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Commencing on March
31, 2022, we are required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize by March 20,
2026 any principal amount outstanding on the PPP Loan as of such date. A portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven by the Small Business
Administration (the &ldquo;SBA&rdquo;) upon our application beginning 60 days but not later than 120 days after loan approval and upon
documentation of expenditures in accordance with the SBA requirements. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum
of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the eight-week period beginning
on the date of loan approval, which eight-week forgiveness period was extended to be the earlier of 24 weeks after funding or December
31, 2021 under the PPP Flexibility Act of 2020 (the &ldquo;PPPFA&rdquo;). Borrowers who received their loan prior to the date of enactment
of this bill may elect to use 8 weeks as their covered period for forgiveness. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll
costs as adjusted by the PPPFA. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven is reduced if our full-time headcount declines or if
salaries and wages for employees with salaries of $100,000 or less annually are reduced by more than 25%. In addition, certain of the
subsidiaries also obtained loan under the PPP. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven,
along with accrued interest, in accordance with the amortization schedule described above, and we cannot provide any assurance that we
will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP Loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA.</P>

PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to
support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation
and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan, and that our receipt
of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the PPP of the CARES Act. The certification described above did not contain
any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. However, on April 23, 2020, and subsequently revised on March 3, 2021, the SBA
issued guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be
able to make the required certification in good faith and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to the SBA, upon request, the
basis for its certification. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the PPP has resulted in significant media coverage and
controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good-faith belief that we satisfied all
eligible requirements for the PPP Loan, we or any company that we may acquire in the future which received a loan under the PPP, are later
determined to have violated any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us or such acquiree in connection with the PPP Loan
or another loan under the PPP, respectively, such as the False Claims Act, or it is otherwise determined that we or such acquiree were
ineligible to receive the PPP Loan or such other loan under the PPP, respectively, we or such acquiree may be subject to penalties, including
significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, and could be required to repay the PPP Loan or such other loan under the PPP,
respectively, in its entirety. In addition, our receipt of the PPP Loan or any company that we may acquire in the future which received
a loan under the PPP may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, and a review or audit by the SBA or other government
entity or claims under the False Claims Act could consume significant financial and management resources.</P>

therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of the lender or terminate our existing

one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt and/or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous

markets have been volatile in the recent past; a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise.
As a result, the inability to meet our debt obligations could cause us to default on those obligations. Any such defaults could materially

to work for us in various aspects of our business. Although we believe that the consultants that we utilize in our business, as is customary
to do so in our business, are properly characterized as independent contractors, tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future
challenge our characterization of independent contractors. We are aware of a number of judicial decisions and legislative proposals that
could bring about major reforms in worker classification,&nbsp;including the California legislature&rsquo;s recent passage of California
Assembly Bill 5 (&ldquo;AB 5&rdquo;). AB 5 purports to codify a new test for determining worker classification that is widely viewed as
expanding the scope of employee relationships and narrowing the scope of independent contractor relationships. Given AB 5&rsquo;s recent
passage, there is no guidance from the regulatory authorities charged with its enforcement, and there is a significant degree of uncertainty
regarding its application. In addition, AB 5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion and it is possible that other jurisdictions,
including New York, may enact similar laws. If such regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that
our recording artists and songwriters are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to
withhold and pay Social Security, Medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. We would also be
liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. As a result, any determination that our consultants are our employees could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the taxes that we would be required
to pay if we were required to remit payroll taxes for our consultants, and the payments that we would be required to make for other employment-related
obligations, our operations would be severely disrupted and individual officers or members of our board of directors could be personally
liable for certain of any assessments made. A government entity could potentially shut down our operations until such time as the payroll
taxes were brought current. Such a shutdown could effectively push us into bankruptcy and an investor could lose all his or her investment
in us.</P>

generally obtain licenses for two types of rights with respect to musical compositions: mechanical rights and public performance rights.
With respect to mechanical rights, for example, in the United States, the rates we pay are, to a significant degree, a function of a ratemaking
proceeding conducted by an administrative agency called the Copyright Royalty Board. The rates that the Copyright Royalty Board set apply
both to compositions that we license under the compulsory license in Section&nbsp;115 of the Copyright Act of 1976 (the &ldquo;Copyright
Act&rdquo;), and to a number of direct licenses that we have with music publishers for U.S. rights, in which the applicable rate is generally
pegged to the statutory rate set by the Copyright Royalty Board. The rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board are also subject to further
change as part of any future Copyright Royalty Board proceedings. If any such rate change increases Slacker&rsquo;s content acquisition
costs and impacts its ability to obtain content on pricing terms favorable to us, it could negatively harm our business, operating results
and financial condition and hinder its ability to provide interactive features in its services, or cause one or more of our services not
to be economically viable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In the United States, public
performance rights are generally obtained through intermediaries known as performing rights organizations (&ldquo;PROs&rdquo;), which
negotiate blanket licenses with copyright users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory, collect royalties under
such licenses, and distribute those royalties to copyright owners. The royalty rates available to Slacker today may not be available to
it in the future. Licenses provided by two of these PROs, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (&ldquo;ASCAP&rdquo;)
and Broadcast Music, Inc. (&ldquo;BMI&rdquo;), cover the majority of the music we stream and are governed by consent decrees relating
to&nbsp;decades old&nbsp;litigations. In&nbsp;2019, the U.S. Department of Justice indicated that it was formally reviewing the relevance
and need of these consent decrees. Changes to the terms of or interpretation of these consent decrees up to and including the dissolution
of the consent decrees, could affect our ability to obtain licenses from these PROs on reasonable terms, which could harm its business,
operating results, and financial condition. In addition, an increase in the number of compositions that must be licensed from PROs that
are not subject to the consent decrees, or from copyright owners that have withdrawn public performance rights from the PROs, could likewise
impede Slacker&rsquo;s ability to license public performance rights on favorable terms. As of March 31, 2021, we owed $0.7 million in
aggregate royalty payments to such PROs.</P>

other parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America, we obtain mechanical and performance licenses for musical compositions
either through local collecting societies representing publishers or from publishers directly, or a combination thereof. We cannot guarantee
that our licenses with collecting societies and its direct licenses with publishers provide full coverage for all of the musical compositions
we make available to our users in such countries. In Asia and Latin America, we are seeing a trend of movement away from blanket licenses
from copyright collectives, which is leading to a fragmented copyright licensing landscape. Publishers, songwriters, and other rights
holders choosing not to be represented by collecting societies could adversely impact our ability to secure favorable licensing arrangements
in connection with musical compositions that such rights holders own or control, including increasing the costs of licensing such musical
compositions, or subjecting us to significant liability for copyright infringement.</P>

license directly with individuals that enable creators to post content directly to our service after agreeing to comply with the applicable
terms and conditions. We are dependent on those who provide content on its service complying with the terms and conditions of its license
agreements as well as the PodcastOne Terms and Conditions of Use (the &ldquo;Terms and Conditions of Use&rdquo;). However, we cannot guarantee
that rights holders or content providers will comply with their obligations, and such failure to do so may materially impact its business,

is also no guarantee that we have all of the licenses it needs to stream content, as the process of obtaining such licenses involves many
rights holders, some of whom are unknown, and myriad complex legal issues across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as
to when and whether particular licenses are needed. Additionally, there is a risk that rights holders, creators, performers, writers and
their agents, or societies, unions, guilds, or legislative or regulatory bodies will create or attempt to create new rights or regulations
that could require Slacker to enter into license agreements with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights holders, some of
which may be difficult or impossible to identify.</P>

indefinitely. For example, from time to time, our license agreements with certain rights holders and/or their agents expire while we negotiate
their renewals and, per industry custom and practice, we may enter into brief (for example, month-, week-, or even days-long) extensions
of those agreements or provisional licenses and/or continue to operate on an at will basis as if the license agreement had been extended,
including by our continuing to make content available. During these periods, we may not have assurance of long-term access to such rights
holders&rsquo; content, which could have a material adverse effect on its business and could lead to potential copyright infringement

We expect that the management teams of the acquired businesses will adopt our policies, procedures and best practices, and cooperate with
each other in scheduling events, booking talent and in other aspects of their operations. We may face difficulty in integrating the operations
of any businesses we may acquire in the future, such as coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with
disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures, the diversion of management&rsquo;s attention from other business
concerns, the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and the
potential loss of key employees, individual service providers, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.</P>

currently expect. Even if we are able to achieve this integration, it may not achieve the benefits we anticipate. If we fail to do this
properly and in a timely manner, it could harm our revenue and relationship with our fans.</P>

the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;) prior to our acquiring them. The Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We will be relying on the proper implementation of our policies
and procedures to remedy any such material weaknesses, and prevent any potential material misstatements in our financial reporting. Any
such misstatement could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial

and to establish ourselves as the key provider of streamed high-quality live music content. The increased focus on acquisitions of such
companies may impede our ability to acquire these companies because they choose another acquirer. It could also increase the price that

certain that the due diligence investigation that we conduct with respect to any investment or acquisition opportunity will reveal or
highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity. For example, instances of fraud,
accounting irregularities and other deceptive practices can be difficult to detect. Executive officers, directors and employees may be
named as defendants in litigation involving a company we are acquiring or have acquired. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on
a particular investment or acquisition, we may fail to uncover all material issues relating to such investment, including regarding the
controls and procedures of a particular target or the full scope of its contractual arrangements. We rely on our due diligence to identify
potential liabilities in the businesses we acquire, including such things as potential or actual lawsuits, contractual obligations or
liabilities imposed by government regulation. However, our due diligence process may not uncover these liabilities, and where we identify
a potential liability, we may incorrectly believe that we can consummate the acquisition without subjecting ourselves to that liability.
Therefore, it is possible that we could be subject to litigation in respect of these acquired businesses. For example, see &ldquo;Item
3. Legal Proceedings&rdquo; regarding our ongoing litigation with Wantickets and its principal. If our due diligence fails to identify
issues specific to an investment or acquisition, we may obtain a lower return from that transaction than the investment would return or
otherwise subject ourselves to unexpected liabilities. We may also be forced to write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations
or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Charges of this nature could contribute to negative market
perceptions about us or our shares of common stock.&nbsp;</P>

of third parties to determine comprehensive and accurate rights holder information for the musical works embodied in the sound recordings
made available on our services. If the information provided to us or obtained by such third parties does not comprehensively or accurately
identify which composers, songwriters or publishers own or administer musical works, or if we are unable to determine which musical works
correspond to specific sound recordings, it may be difficult to identify the appropriate rights holders from whom a license is required,
to identify the applicable rights holders to pay and/or to comply with other applicable terms and obligations of the licenses. Our failure
to timely obtain licenses and/or comply with such terms or obligations may subject us to significant liability for copyright infringement

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, music, Internet,
technology, and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other
violations of intellectual property rights. Many companies in these industries, including many of our competitors, have substantially
larger patent and intellectual property portfolios than we do, which could make us a target for litigation as we may not be able to assert
counterclaims against parties that sue us for patent, or other intellectual property infringement. In addition, various&nbsp;&ldquo;non-practicing&nbsp;entities&rdquo;
that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert claims in order to extract value from technology
companies. Further, from time to time we may introduce new products and services, including in territories where we currently do not have
an offering, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and&nbsp;non-practicing&nbsp;entities.
It is difficult to predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims
arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we are forced to defend
against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined
in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse
outcome of a dispute may require us to pay significant damages, which may be even greater if we are found to have willfully infringed
upon a party&rsquo;s intellectual property; cease exploiting copyrighted content that we have previously had the ability to exploit; cease
using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources
to redesign our solutions; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary
technologies, content, or materials; indemnify our partners and other third parties; and/or take other actions that may have material

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We use open source software
in connection with our website and our live music streaming network and may use open source software in the future. The terms of many
open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source
software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute
our products or services. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their own software
product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or make available any derivative works of the open
source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership
of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our
proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in
litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated
products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant
additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to license
requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source
licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate
or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we
have assessed the use of open source software on our website to ensure that we have not used open source software in a manner that would
require us to disclose the source code to the related technology, use requiring such disclosure could inadvertently occur and any requirement
to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to us.&nbsp;</P>

business. To the extent that network operators implement usage-based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to
monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention
could be negatively impacted. For example, in late 2010, Comcast informed Level 3 Communications that it would require Level 3 to pay
for the ability to access Comcast&rsquo;s network. Furthermore, to the extent network operators were to create tiers of Internet access
service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.</P>

provide consumers with access to the Internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, companies like
Comcast, Charter Spectrum and Cablevision have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth
and success. For example, Comcast exempted certain of its own Internet video traffic (e.g., Streampix videos to the Xbox 360) from a bandwidth
cap that applies to all unaffiliated Internet video traffic (e.g., Netflix videos to the Xbox 360). While we believe that consumer demand,
regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential
treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively
impacted. In international markets, especially in Latin America, these same incentives apply; however, the consumer demand, regulatory
oversight and competition may not be as strong as in our domestic market.</P>

maintained by businesses. Prompted by the FTC&rsquo;s recommendation regarding online tracking, a number of federal legislative proposals

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The laws in this area are
complex and developing rapidly. For instance, on April 14, 2016, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the &ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) became
effective within Europe on May 25, 2018. The primary objectives of the GDPR are to give citizens of the EU back the control of their personal
data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU. We have not yet assessed
the full effect of the GDPR. Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in significant monetary penalties. As we expand our operations
into new jurisdictions, the costs associated with compliance with applicable local data privacy laws and regulations increases. It is
possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes and/or make changes
to our products, services and operations, which will increase operational cost and risk. There is a risk that Internet browsers, operating
systems, or other applications might be modified by their developers in response to this regulation to limit or block our ability to access
information about our users. It is possible that existing or future regulations could make it difficult or impossible for us to collect
or use our user information in the way we would like which would impede our growth strategy and potentially reduce the revenue we hope
to generate. It is also possible that we could be found to have violated regulations relating to user data, which could result in us being
sanctioned, suffering fines or other punishment, being restricted in our activities and/or suffering reputational harm. Any of the foregoing
could adversely affect our business and financial results.&nbsp;</P>

than we offer and some may be offered internationally more broadly than our PodcastOne service. In addition, internet radio providers
may leverage their existing infrastructure and content libraries, as well as their brand recognition and user base, to augment their services
by offering competing on-demand podcast features to provide users with more comprehensive podcast service delivery choices. Terrestrial
radio providers often offer their content for free, are well-established and accessible to consumers, and offer media content that we
currently do not offer. In addition, many terrestrial radio stations have begun broadcasting digital signals, which provide high-quality
audio transmission. Satellite radio providers, such as SiriusXM and iHeartRadio, may offer extensive and exclusive news, comedy, sports
and talk content, and national signal coverage.</P>

with a combination of technical expertise, brand recognition, financial resources, and digital media experience also pose a significant
threat of developing competing on-demand audio distribution technologies. In particular, if known incumbents in the digital media space
such as Facebook choose to offer competing services, they may devote greater resources than we have available, have a more accelerated
time frame for deployment, and leverage their existing user base and proprietary technologies to provide services that our users and advertisers
may view as superior. Furthermore, Amazon Music, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, iHeartMusic and others have competing podcast services,
which may negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our current and future competitors may have higher
brand recognition, more established relationships with content licensors and mobile device manufacturers, greater financial, technical,
and other resources, more sophisticated technologies, and/or more experience in the markets in which we compete. Our current and future
competitors may also engage in mergers or acquisitions with each other, as SiriusXM and Pandora have done, or to acquire smaller podcasting
services, such as Spotify has done, to combine and leverage their audiences. Our current and future competitors may innovate new features
or introduce new ways of consuming or engaging with content that cause our users, especially the younger demographic, to switch to another
product, which would negatively affect our user retention, growth, and engagement. In addition, Apple and Google also own application
store platforms and are charging in-application purchase fees, which are not being levied on their own applications, thus creating a competitive
advantage for themselves against us. If other competitors that own application store platforms and competitive services adopt similar
practices, we may be similarly impacted. As the market for on-demand audio on the internet and mobile and connected devices increases,
new competitors, business models, and solutions are likely to emerge.</P>

application stores, including several large, well-funded, and seasoned participants in the digital media market. Device application stores
often offer users the ability to browse applications by various criteria, such as the number of downloads in a given time period, the
length of time since an application was released or updated, or the category in which the application is placed. The websites and applications
of our competitors may rank higher than our website and our PodcastOne application, and our application may be difficult to locate in
device application stores, which could draw potential users away from our service and toward those of our competitors. If we are unable
to compete successfully for users against other digital media providers by maintaining and increasing our presence, ease of use, and visibility
online, on devices, and in application stores, our number of premium subscribers, ad-supported users, and the amount of content streamed
on our service may fail to increase or may decline and our subscription fees and advertising sales may suffer.</P>

effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, pricing structure, and ability to deliver large volumes or precise types of advertisements

agreements contain minimum guarantees and/or require that we make minimum guarantee payments. Such minimum guarantees related to our content
acquisition costs are not always tied to our revenue and/or user&nbsp;growth forecasts (e.g.,&nbsp;number of&nbsp;users, active users,
premium subscribers), or the number of podcasts used on our service. We may also be subject to minimum guarantees to rights holders with
respect to certain strategic partnerships we enter into that may not&nbsp;produce all of the expected benefits.&nbsp;Accordingly, our
ability to achieve and sustain profitability and operating leverage on our service in part depends on our ability to increase our revenue
through increased sales of premium service and advertising sales on terms that maintain an adequate gross margin. The duration of our
license agreements for podcast content&nbsp;that contain minimum guarantees is&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;between one and two years, but our
premium subscribers may cancel their subscriptions at any time. If our forecasts of premium subscriber acquisition or retention do not
meet our expectations or the number of our premium subscribers or advertising sales decline significantly during the term of our license
agreements, our margins may be materially and adversely affected. To the extent our premium service revenue growth or advertising sales
do not meet our expectations, our business, operating results, and financial condition could also be adversely affected as a result of
such minimum guarantees. In addition, the fixed cost nature of these minimum guarantees may limit our flexibility in planning for, or
reacting to, changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate.</P>

to forecast whether such minimum guarantees could be recouped against our actual content acquisition costs incurred over the duration

leading to content acquisition costs that do not exceed such minimum guarantees, our margins may be materially and adversely affected.</P>

to deliver podcasts and other non-music content involves numerous risks and challenges, including increased capital requirements, new
competitors, and the need to develop new strategic relationships. Growth in these areas may require additional changes to our existing
business model and cost structure, modifications to our infrastructure, and exposure to new regulatory, legal and reputational risks,
including infringement liability, any of which may require additional expertise that we currently do not have. There is no guarantee that
we will be able to generate sufficient revenue from podcasts or other non-music content to offset the costs of creating or acquiring this
content. Further, we have initially established a reputation as a music streaming service and our ability to gain acceptance and listenership
for podcasts or other non-music content, and thus our ability to attract users and advertisers to this content, is not certain. Failure
to successfully monetize and generate revenues from such content, including failure to obtain or retain rights to podcasts or other non-music
content on acceptable terms, or at all, or to effectively manage the numerous risks and challenges associated with such expansion could
adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.</P>

multi-year commitments for original content that we produce or commission. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature
of such commitments, if our user growth and retention do not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Payment terms
for certain content that we produce or commission will typically require more upfront cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements
whereby we do not pay for the production of such content. To the extent our user and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our
liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of such content commitments. The long-term and fixed cost
nature of certain content commitments may also limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, as well as
our ability to adjust our content offering if our users do not react favorably to the content we produce. Any such event could adversely

into contracts with our podcast content creators under which such creators are usually paid a certain percentage of the ad sales and other
revenue that we generate related to their podcast. The compensation to a top podcast content creator may increase as the competition intensifies.
If our content creators become too costly, we will not be able to produce high quality content at commercially acceptable costs. If our
competitors&rsquo; platforms offer higher revenue sharing percentage with an intent to attract our popular podcast content creators, costs
to retain such content creators may increase. Furthermore, as our business and user base further expand, we may have to devote more resources

negatively impact retailer and consumer relationships and negatively impact our reputation. The difficulty in forecasting demand also
makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to
accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to
forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.</P>

the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as notebooks

existing technologies and business applications to keep pace with these rapidly changing and continuously evolving technologies, and we
may be required to implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of these upgrades and changes
requires significant investments and as new devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter
in developing applications for these alternative devices and platforms. Additionally, we may need to devote significant resources to the
support and maintenance of such applications once created. Our results of operations may be affected by the timing, effectiveness and
costs associated with the successful implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such alternative
devices and platforms. Further, in the event that it is more difficult or less compelling for our customers to buy products from us on
their mobile or other devices, or if our customers choose not to buy products from us on such devices or to use mobile or other products
that do not offer access to our sites, our customer growth could be harmed and our business, financial condition and operating results

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our business is highly dependent
upon email and other messaging services for promoting our sites and products. Daily promotions offered through emails and other messages
sent by us generate a significant portion of our net revenue. We provide daily emails and &quot;push&quot; communications to customers
and other visitors informing them of what is available for purchase on our sites, and we believe these messages are an important part
of our customer experience and help generate a substantial portion of our net revenue. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails
or other messages to our email subscribers, or if our email subscribers decline to open our emails or other messages, our net revenue
and profitability would be materially adversely affected. Changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may also reduce
the number of subscribers opening our emails. For example, in 2013 Google Inc.'s Gmail service began offering a feature that organizes
incoming emails into categories (for example, primary, social and promotions). Such categorization or similar inbox organizational features
may result in our emails being delivered in a less prominent location in a subscriber's inbox or viewed as &ldquo;spam&rdquo; by our subscribers
and may reduce the likelihood of that subscriber opening our emails. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge
for the delivery of emails or other messages could also adversely impact our business. From time to time, Internet service providers or
other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to
successfully deliver emails or other messages to third parties. Changes in the laws or regulations that limit our ability to send such
communications or impose additional requirements upon us in connection with sending such communications would also materially adversely
impact our business. Our use of email and other messaging services to send communications about our products and site or other matters
may also result in legal claims against us, which may cause us increased expenses, and if successful might result in fines and orders
with costly reporting and compliance obligations or might limit or prohibit our ability to send emails or other messages. We also rely
on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms
of these social networking services to limit promotional communications, any restrictions that would limit our ability or our customers'
ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline
in the use of or engagement with social networking services by customers and potential customers could materially adversely affect our

we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit
cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also
subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for
us to comply. As our business changes, we may also be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments
that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of
a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently
accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction
fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from consumers or to facilitate
other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. We occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. We may suffer losses as a result
of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current
credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud,
our liability for these transactions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>

regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e- commerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes,
tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection, Internet
neutrality and gift cards. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer
privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate
or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those
specifically governing the Internet or e-commerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction
to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply
fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could
result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such
proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management,
increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our sites by consumers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary
liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance

ability to retain or increase our customer base may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to maintain or grow our net revenue
and expand our business as anticipated. Further, as we enter into new market segments or geographical areas and expand the products and

or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing
the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or
court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, on June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme
Court rendered a 5-4 majority decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., 17-494 where the Court held, among other things, that a state
may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to
consumers in the state, overturning existing court precedent. While we do not expect the Court's decision to have a significant impact
on our business, other new or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes and similar taxes could increase the cost of doing business
online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the Internet. New taxes and rulings could also create significant increases
in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and operating results.</P>

As a result, we may be subject to shipping delays or disruptions caused by inclement weather, natural disasters, system interruptions
and technology failures, labor activism, health epidemics (including the COVID-19 outbreak) or bioterrorism. We are also subject to risks
of breakage or other damage during delivery by any of these third parties. We also use and rely on other services from third parties,
such as cloud computing services, telecommunications services, customs, consolidation and shipping services, as well as warranty, installation,
assembly and design services. We may be unable to maintain these relationships, and these services may also be subject to outages and
interruptions that are not within our control. For example, failures by our telecommunications providers have in the past and may in the
future interrupt our ability to provide phone support to our customers. Third parties may in the future determine they no longer wish
to do business with us or may decide to take other actions that could harm our business. We may also determine that we no longer want
to do business with them. If products are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged during the delivery process, or if we are not

The costs of supporting such litigation and disputes are considerable, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be
obtained. As our business expands and the number of competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, we expect that infringement
claims may increase in number and significance. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming,
result in considerable litigation costs, require significant amounts of management time or result in the diversion of significant operational

our acquisition of React Presents in February 2020, we produce, promote and manage music in person live festivals and events, including
Spring Awakening, Mamby on the Beach, Summer Set Music &amp; Camping Festival, Freaky Deaky and Reaction New Year&rsquo;s Eve. In 2020,
we also launched in-house our new annual digital festival, Music Lives, and digital streaming series and events, Music Lives ON and LiveXLive
Presents. Our festival and events growth strategy relies on the strength of these brands to attract customers to our in person festivals
and events, both through attendance at the original festivals and markets and in new markets, as well as to our online digital properties.
We also rely on the strength of these brands to secure sponsorships and marketing partners and to facilitate growth in revenue from the
sale of music and other content, as well as advertising on our online properties. Maintaining the strength of our festivals, events and
online businesses will be challenging, and our relationship with our fans could be harmed for many reasons, including the quality of the
experience at a particular festival or event, our competitors developing more popular events or attracting talent from our businesses,
adverse occurrences or publicity in connection with an event and changes to public tastes that are beyond our control and difficult to
anticipate. If our key properties become less popular with consumers within the particular music community, such as electronic music culture
(&ldquo;EMC&rdquo;), our growth strategy would be harmed, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial results.</P>

growth of the popularity of electronic music and the EMC community, however, this growth is subject to the whims of public taste, which
may change over time and may be beyond our control. While interest in electronic music has increased significantly over the past few years,
this increased interest may not continue, and it is possible that the public&rsquo;s current level of interest in electronic music will
decline. If either were to happen, the demand for and interest in EMC festivals, events and venues and our online properties could fail
to meet our expectations or even decline. This would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.</P>

the growing EMC community, there has been a significant increase in the number of EMC festivals and events due to the creation of new
events and the expansion of existing events, both in geography and duration. Our growth strategy includes increasing the number of EMC
festivals and events we produce each year, as well as increasing the frequency of established events by bringing them to new cities and
countries. It is possible that the proliferation of EMC festivals and events will outpace demand. Further, many of the largest festivals
attract fans who travel great distances to attend. It is possible that an increase in the availability of local quality EMC festivals
and events will make it less likely that these fans will travel to the same festivals in other locations. If either were to occur, it
could make it difficult for us to achieve the increase in overall attendance that is part of our growth strategy or force us to offer
tickets at reduced prices, either of which would adversely affect our business and financial results.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">We
incur a significant amount of up-front costs when we plan and prepare for a festival or event. Accordingly, if a planned festival or event
is canceled, we would lose a substantial amount of sunk costs, fail to generate the anticipated revenue and may be forced to issue refunds
for tickets sold. If we are forced to postpone a planned festival or event, we would incur substantial additional costs in connection
with our having to stage the event on a new date, may have reduced attendance and revenue and may have to refund money to ticketholders.
In addition, any cancellation or postponement could harm both our reputation and the reputation of the particular festival or event. We
could be compelled to cancel or postpone all or part of an event or festival for many reasons, including such things as low attendance,
adverse weather conditions, technical problems, issues with permitting or government regulation, incidents, injuries or deaths at that
event or festival, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents and natural disasters
or similar events. In 2019, Mamby on the Beach festival was canceled due to circumstances beyond then owner&rsquo;s control. In 2020,
due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and various government actions taken as a result, we postponed React Presents&rsquo; flagship annual
Spring Awakening festival from 2020 to 2021 and canceled most of the 2020 events and festivals that React produces. While we hope to hold
our Spring Awakening festival in the 2021 calendar year which is currently scheduled for October 2021, there can be no assurances that
we will be able to hold such festival or any other in-person festival or events in 2021 or thereafter, pending the developments of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We often have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our insured losses if we are compelled
to cancel an event or festival, but our coverage may not be sufficient and may be subject to deductibles. The occurrence of an extraordinary
condition in the geographic region or at or near the site where a festival or event will be held may make it impossible or difficult to
stage the event or make it difficult for attendees to travel to the site of a festival or event. For example, as of the date of this Annual
Report, U.S. and global restrictions on travel and related required quarantine times imposed as a result of COVID-19, may make it nearly
impossible or very difficult to stage the event or for attendees to travel to the site of a festival or event. An extraordinary incident
may also make it inappropriate to hold a festival or event at a particular site or at a particular time.</P>

is currently a tremendous amount of innovation among EMC-focused businesses, including the different experiential aspects of festivals
and other live performances. These include things such as video presentations, lighting, special effects, sets and other creative elements.
Businesses in the EMC industry compete, in part, based on their ability to provide experiences for their audiences that are both cutting
edge and compelling. Innovation in our industry is taking place both at the companies that produce festivals and events, as well as at
smaller companies that are retained by producers and performers to create artistic elements to accompany the music and enhance the experience
of the fans. We must be able to match the quality and inventiveness of these competitors at our own festivals and events. If we fail to
do so, it could lead to reduced demand for tickets to our festivals and events, harm our reputation or the reputation of our festivals
and events and adversely affect our business and financial results.</P>

create, and it would be expensive and time consuming to repair or replace them. We have insurance policies in place to cover a portion

are inherent risks in live festivals and events, particularly those like ours, which involve complex staging and special effects. As a
result, personal injuries and accidents have occurred in the concert industry in general, including some that have injured or killed employees
and guests. Injuries and accidents occurring in connection with our festivals, events or venues could subject us to negative publicity,
as well as claims and liabilities, and certain of the businesses we have acquired or plan to acquire have been subject to such claims.
Injuries and accidents occurring in connection with our live festivals and events, or at any of the venues we manage, or any actual or
alleged spread of COVID-19 potentially tied to our festivals could also harm our reputation with artists and fans and make it more difficult
for us to obtain sponsors. News of any such incident or accident could also reduce attendance at our events or lead to the cancellation
of all or part of an event or festival, in each case leading to a decrease in our revenue. While we maintain insurance policies that provide
coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management&rsquo;s judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries
sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that this insurance will
be adequate at all times and in all circumstances. In particular, if there were to be a major incident resulting in multiple deaths or
injuries at one of our events or venues, it is unlikely our insurance would cover the full liability. We would be responsible for any
liabilities not covered by our insurance policies, which would negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations.</P>

litigation of &ldquo;dram shop&rdquo; laws and regulations targeted at restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including
many recent instances of punitive damages; such laws may be extended to apply to our events and festivals. While we carry customary live
events insurance as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, we may still be subject to a judgment in excess of
our insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to maintain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs, if at all.
Regardless of whether any claims made against us are valid or whether we are liable, we may be adversely affected by negative publicity
resulting from such laws.</P>

at events, particularly those that involve drugs and alcohol. Additionally, new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact

business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events. Our
live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them.
Since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events, any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular
artists could limit our ability to generate revenue. Our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents
do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated, or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated
due to changing tastes, general economic conditions or otherwise. Our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform
live entertainment, sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events.</P>

addition, our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours in advance of the beginning of a live event and often agrees
to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue. Therefore, if the public is not receptive to the live event,
or we or an artist cancel the show, we may incur a loss for the event depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs
relative to any revenue earned, as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues. We do have cancellation insurance policies in
place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles.
Furthermore, consumer preferences change from time to time, and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result
in reduced demand for our services, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</P>

conditions, we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue, which would increase our

a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating losses (&ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) and tax credits existing as of the
date of such ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of a company&rsquo;s
stock within a rolling three-year period. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered
by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances
of stock by the company. As a result of these Section 382 and 383 limitations, any ownership changes as defined by Section 382 and 383

of factors including share price, general and business market conditions, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, corporate and
regulatory requirements, and alternative uses of capital. The program may be expanded, suspended, or discontinued by our board of directors
at any time. Although our board of directors has authorized this stock repurchase program, there is no guarantee as to the exact number
of shares, if any, that will be repurchased by us, and we may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional
purchases are not warranted. We cannot guarantee that the program will be consummated, fully or all, or that it will enhance long-term
stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our common stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination
of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, this program could diminish our cash reserves.&nbsp;As

distribution and monetization of live music, Internet radio, podcasting and music-related streaming and video content. Our principal operations
and decision-making functions are located in North America. We manage and report our businesses as a single operating segment. Our chief
operating decision maker regularly reviews our operating results, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and
to measure our segment and consolidated operating performance. We previously generated a majority of our revenue through subscription
services from our streaming radio and music services, and to a lesser extent through advertising and licensing across our music platform.
In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we began generating ticketing, sponsorship, and promotion-related revenue
from live music events through our February 2020 acquisition of React Presents. In May 2020, we launched a new PPV offering enabling new
forms of artist revenue including digital tickets, tipping, digital meet and greets, merchandise sales and sponsorship. In July 2020,
we entered the podcasting business with the acquisition of PodcastOne and in December 2020, we entered the merchandising business with
the acquisition of CPS.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">For our fiscal year ended
March 31, 2020, we derived 93% of our revenue from paid customers&rsquo; subscriptions and the remainder from advertising, ticketing,
sponsorship and licensing. During fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we (i) acquired PodcastOne (effective July 1, 2020) and CPS (effective
December 22, 2020), (ii) accelerated the number of live events digitally live streamed across our platform, (iii) increased our sponsorship
revenue from live events when compared to prior fiscal years and (iv) successfully launched our Pay Per View (&ldquo;PPV&rdquo;) platform,
allowing us to charge customers directly to access and watch certain live events digitally on our music platform. As a result of these
actions, our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 was comprised of 51% from paid customers&rsquo; subscriptions, 32% from
advertising (which includes PodcastOne), 8% from merchandise (which includes CPS) and 9% from ticketing and sponsorship and licensing.
Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our on-premise live events, concerts and festivals through React Presents and our
programmatic advertising as more fully discussed below. Until the impact of COVID-19 eases around the world and related government actions
are relaxed in the markets in which we operate, we do not expect to produce on-premise live music events and generate revenue through
co-promotion fees, sponsorships, food and beverage and ticket sales of on-premise live events in the near term.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We believe there is substantial
near and long-term value in our live music content. We believe the monetary value of broadcasting live music will follow a similar evolution
to live sporting events such as the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, whereby sports
broadcasting rights became more valuable as the demand for live sporting events increased over the past 20 years. As a thought leader
in live music, we plan to acquire the broadcasting rights to as many of the top live music events and festivals that are available to
us. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we livestreamed 146 major festivals and live music events compared to 42 in the prior
fiscal year. With this acceleration in livestreamed events, we also experienced increases in monetization of these events from paid sponsorships
and pay per view ticket purchases. In the near term, we will continue aggregating our digital traffic across these festivals and monetizing
the live broadcasting of these events through advertising, brand sponsorships and licensing of certain broadcasting rights outside of
North America. The long-term economics of any future agreement involving festivals, programming, production, broadcasting, streaming,
advertising, sponsorships, and licensing could positively or negatively impact our liquidity, growth, margins, relationships, and ability
to deploy and grow our future services with current or future customers, and are heavily dependent upon the easing and elimination of
the COVID-19 pandemic.</P>

live events, we have also begun to package, produce and broadcast our live music content on a 24/7/365 basis across our music platform
and grow our paid subscribers. Recently, we have entered into distribution relationships with a variety of platforms, including Roku,
Samsung, AppleTV, Amazon Fire, liner OTT platforms such as STIRR, Sling and XUMO. As we continue to have more distribution channels, rights
and viewership and expand our original programming capabilities, we believe there is a substantial opportunity to increase our brand,
advertising, viewership and subscription capabilities and corresponding revenue, domestically and globally.</P>

and performance are, and will continue to be, driven by various factors that affect the music industry. Our ability to attract, grow and
retain users to our platform is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public music preferences and technology and is dependent on our ability
to maintain the attractiveness of our platform, content and reputation to our customers. Beyond fiscal year 2021, the future revenue and
operating growth across our music platform will rely heavily on our ability to grow our subscriber base in a cost effective manner, continue
to develop and deploy quality and innovative new music services, provide unique and attractive content to our customers, continue to grow

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">As our music platform continues
to evolve, we believe there are opportunities to expand our services by adding more content in a greater variety of formats such as podcasts
and vodcasts, extending our distribution to include pay television, OTT and social channels, deploying new services for our subscribers,
artist merchandise and live music event ticket sales, and licensing user data across our platform. Our acquisitions of PodcastOne and
CPS are reflective of our flywheel operating model. Conversely, the evolution of technology presents an inherent risk to our business.
Today, we see large opportunities to expand our music services within North America and other parts of the world where we will need to
make substantial investments to improve our current service offerings. As a result, and during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021,
we will continue to invest in product and engineering to further develop our future music apps and services, and we expect to continue
making significant product development investments to our existing technology solutions over the next 12 to 24 months to address these
opportunities.</P>

also expect our contribution margins and AOL to improve in the near and long term, which are Non-GAAP measures as defined in section following
below titled, &ldquo;Non-GAAP Measures&rdquo;. Historically, our live events business has not generated enough direct revenue to cover
the costs to produce such events, and as a result generated negative contribution margins* and operating losses. Beginning in late March
2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on on-premise live music events and festivals. Historically, we produced and digitally
distributed the live music performances of many of these large global music events to fans all around the world. With the elimination
of any fan-attended music events, festivals and concerts, we shifted our operating model beginning in April 2020 towards self-producing
live music events that were 100% digital (e.g., artists not performing in front of live fans and solely for digital distribution). In
April 2020, we also launched our first all-digital music festival, Music Lives, which aired continuously for over 48 straight hours, with
nearly 100 artists and generated over 50 million livestreams and over 6.5 billion video views of the of hashtag <I>#musiclives</I> across
TikTok. Music Lives was simulcast across our platform and on TikTok&rsquo;s platform, who also sponsored the event. In March 2021, we
held our second annual Music Lives festival, which featured 130 artists performing over 72 continuous hours generating nearly 28 million
livestreams.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Growth in our music services
is also dependent upon the number of customers that use and pay for our services, the attractiveness of our music platform to sponsors
and advertisers and our ability to negotiate favorable economic terms with music labels, publishers, artists and/or festival owners, and
the number of consumers who use our services. Growth in our margins is heavily dependent on our ability to grow the subscriber base in
a cost-efficient manner, coupled with the managing the costs associated with implementing and operating our services, including the costs
of licensing music with the music labels, producing, streaming and distributing video and audio content and sourcing and distributing
personalized products and gifts. Our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers will be highly dependent on our abilities
to implement and continually improve upon our technology and services on a timely basis and continually improve our network and operations
as technology changes and as we experience increased network capacity constraints as we continue to grow.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">For the majority of our agreements
with festival owners, we acquire the global broadcast rights. Moreover, the digital rights we acquire principally include any format and
screen, and future rights to VR and AR. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, all material amounts of our revenue were derived
from customers located in the United States and moreover, one of our customers accounted for 36% of our consolidated revenue. This significant
concentration of revenue from one customer poses risks to our operating results, and any change in the means this customer utilizes our
services beyond March 31, 2021 could cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly. Moreover, and with the addition of PodcastOne and CPS
in July and December 2020, respectively, the percentage of this customer revenue concentration decreased substantially and this trend
is expected to continue in the future. In the long term, we plan to expand our business further internationally in places such as Europe,
Asia Pacific and Latin America, and as a result will continue to incur significant incremental upfront expenses associated with these
growth opportunities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">An outbreak of a novel strain
of coronavirus, COVID-19 in December 2019 subsequently became a pandemic after spreading globally, including the United States. While
the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially adversely affect our financial results and business operations during the fiscal year ended March
31, 2020, it did adversely impact parts of our business during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, namely our live events and programmatic
advertising. Due to the global pandemic and government actions taking in response, since March 2020, all in person festivals, concerts
and events have either been canceled or suspended, and it is uncertain when they will be permitted to resume, and as a result, the COVID-19
pandemic had an adverse impact on on-premise live music festivals, concerts and events. Major global music festivals have been postponed
until 2021 or indefinitely. With our acquisition of React Presents in February 2020, we were unable to produce and promote more than 200
forecasted live events in fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, including our flagship live event Spring Awakening festival, which is typically
annually produced in June. In January 2021, we announced our first-ever expansion of Spring Awakening music festival (&ldquo;SAMF&rdquo;)
outside of Chicago with its first edition of &ldquo;Spring Awakening Excursions&rdquo; Cancun Awakening music festival which is a live
event held from April 28 to May 2, 2021. However, further outbreaks of COVID-19 have caused the postponement of this event. Moreover,
our programmatic advertising is presently adversely impacted as COVID-19 caused a subset of our legacy advertising mix and demand to decline
and as a result, overall advertising cost per thousand impressions/rates across our platform were subsequently reduced. Further, as of
the date of this Annual Report, we are not livestreaming any fan attended live festivals, concerts or other in-person live events on our
platform or channels and it is unclear when streaming of fan attended live festivals, concerts or other in-person live events will again
become regularly available to us. Conversely, while the economic and health conditions in the United States and across the globe have
changed rapidly since the end of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we are presently experiencing growth in certain parts of our core
business, including (i) growth in the number of live music events produced digitally and livestreamed during fiscal year ended March 31,
2021(146 live events) as compared to fiscal year March 31, 2020 (42 live events), (ii) improvement in the monetization of these digital
livestreams, which exceeded prior fiscal year by over 1,188% and (iii) new growth opportunities across our music platform, including podcasts,
vodcasts, merchandising and PPV. In addition, the outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that governments, other third parties
or we may take in respect of the coronavirus may result in a period of business disruption and reduced operations. For example, our largest
customer was ordered to keep its main U.S. factory closed for a substantial amount of time during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.</P>

attributable to acquisition activity, (c) employee severance payments and third party professional fees directly attributable to acquisition

if any), and (g) certain stock-based compensation expense.&nbsp;We use AOI/(AOL) to evaluate the performance of our operating segment.
We believe that information about AOI/(AOL) assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our business
separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors
that affect reported results. AOI/(AOL) is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of the use of AOI/(AOL) as
a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business.
Accordingly, AOI/(AOL) should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and
other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus,
AOI/(AOL) as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.</P>

We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with our revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, the assigned value

the customer uses the services or not. As a result, we have concluded that the best measure of progress toward the complete satisfaction

Providers promote the Slacker app through their e-store, process payments for subscriptions, and retain a percentage of revenue as a fee.
We report this revenue gross of the fee retained by the Mobile Providers, as the subscriber is Slacker&rsquo;s customer in the contract
and Slacker controls the service prior to the transfer to the subscriber. Subscription revenues from monthly subscriptions sold directly
through Mobile Providers are subject to such Mobile Providers&rsquo; refund or cancellation terms. Revenues from Mobile Providers are
recognized net of any such adjustments for variable consideration, including refunds and other fees. Our payment terms vary based on whether
the subscription is sold on a direct basis or through Mobile Providers. Subscriptions sold on a direct basis require payment before the
services are delivered to the customer. The payment terms for subscriptions sold through Mobile Providers vary, but are generally payable
within 30 days.</P>

value of stock options. This model requires us to estimate the expected volatility and the expected term of the stock options which are
highly complex and subjective variables. The variables take into consideration, among other things, actual and projected employee stock
option exercise behavior. We use a predicted volatility of its stock price during the expected life of the options that is based on the
historical performance of our stock price as well as including an estimate using guideline companies. Expected term is computed using
the simplified method as the Company&rsquo;s best estimate given its lack of actual exercise history. We have selected a risk-free rate
based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected term of the stock. Stock-based
awards are comprised principally of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (&ldquo;RSUs&rdquo;), restricted stock awards
and warrant grants. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred.</P>

using the purchase method of accounting where the cost is allocated to the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired, based
on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured
as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally, any contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date
and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration
transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed
liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management&rsquo;s

valuation methodology, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimates of customer

of our intangible assets, and other long-lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. These trigger events or changes in circumstances include,
but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or
manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, significant adverse changes in legal factors, including changes that could result from
our inability to renew or replace material agreements with certain of our partners such as Tesla Motors on favorable terms, significant
adverse changes in the business climate including changes which may result from adverse shifts in technology in our industry and the impact
of competition, a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows we expect to generate from an asset group,
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long-lived
asset, current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of our long-lived asset,
or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the
end of its previously estimated useful life. We perform impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In making this determination,
we consider the specific operating characteristics of the relevant long-lived assets, including (i) the nature of the direct and any indirect
revenues generated by the assets; (ii) the interdependency of the revenues generated by the assets; and (iii) the nature and extent of
any shared costs necessary to operate the assets in their intended use. An impairment test would be performed when the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group is less than its carrying amount. Impairment is measured by assessing
the usefulness of an asset by comparing its carrying value to its fair value. If an asset is considered impaired, the impairment loss
is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is determined based
upon estimated discounted future cash flows. The key estimates applied when preparing cash flow projections relate to revenue, operating
margins, economic lives of assets, overheads, taxation and discount rates. To date, we have not recognized any such impairment loss associated
with our long-lived assets.</P>

at the reporting unit level, which is the same or one level below an operating segment. In any year we may elect to perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value.
If we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment,
we perform a quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis is used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of the
impairment loss by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The estimated fair
value is based on internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans, as well as market conditions relative to the
operations of our reporting units. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting
unit is not impaired; otherwise, an impairment loss is recognized within our consolidated statements of operations in an amount equal
to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.</P>

infrastructure and equipment for our business offerings, and sale of our investments. We expect to make additional strategic acquisitions
to further grow our business, which may require significant investments, capital raising and/or acquisition of additional debt in the
near and long term. Over the next twelve to eighteen months, our net use of our working capital could be substantially higher or lower
depending on the number and timing of new live festivals and paid subscribers that we add to our businesses.</P>

utilize additional commercial financings, bonds, debentures, lines of credit and term loans with a syndicate of commercial banks or other
bank syndicates and/or issue equity securities (publicly or privately) for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and investing
in our intangible assets, music equipment, platform and technologies. We may also use our current cash and cash equivalents to repurchase
some or all of our unsecured convertible notes, and pay down our debt, in part or in full, subject to repayment limitation set forth in
the credit agreement. Management plans to fund its operations over the next twelve months through the combination of improved operating
results, spending rationalization, and the ability to access sources of capital such as through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities.
No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to us. We filed a universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3, effective February 7, 2019, allowing us to issue various types of
securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, units, or any combination of such securities, up to an
aggregate amount of $150 million.</P>

audit matter. The Company&rsquo;s estimation of the acquisition date fair values of certain identifiable intangible assets and contingent
consideration is complex, requires management&rsquo;s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including,
selection of the appropriate valuation methodology, revenue, expense, cash flow projections, royalty rates, and discount rates. Additionally,
the valuation of the contingent consideration payable to the sellers of PodcastOne required complex management judgement with respect
to certain inputs used in the valuation model such as the credit yield. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor
judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skills and

together with its subsidiaries (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; &ldquo;our&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a Delaware corporation
headquartered in Beverly Hills, California. The Company is a global platform for livestream and on-demand audio, video and podcast content

in the State of Delaware on August 2, 2017, pursuant to a reincorporation merger of Loton, Corp (&ldquo;Loton&rdquo;) with and into LiveXLive,
Loton&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary at the time. As a result of the reincorporation merger, Loton ceased to exist as a separate entity,
with LiveXLive being the surviving entity. In addition, on December 29, 2017, LiveXLive acquired Slacker, Inc. (&ldquo;Slacker&rdquo;),
an Internet music and radio streaming service incorporated in the state of Delaware, and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of LiveXLive.
On February 5, 2020, LiveXLive&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary, LiveXLive Events, LLC (&ldquo;LiveXLive Events&rdquo;), acquired (i) React
Presents, LLC a Delaware limited liability company (&ldquo;React Presents&rdquo;), and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of LiveXLive
Events, and (ii) indirectly Spring Awakening, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of React Presents, a producer, promoter and manager
of in person live music festivals and events. On July 1, 2020, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, LiveXLive PodcastOne,
Inc., acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Courtside Group, Inc. (dba PodcastOne) (&ldquo;PodcastOne&rdquo;)
(see Note 4 &ndash; Business Combinations).&nbsp;On December 22, 2020, the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary LiveXLive Merchandising,

statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Acquisitions are included in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated
financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company uses purchase accounting for its acquisitions, which results in all
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. See the Company&rsquo;s
accounting policy &ldquo;<I>Business Combinations&rdquo; </I>within Note 2 &ndash; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. All intercompany

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company&rsquo;s principal
sources of liquidity have historically been its debt and equity issuances and its cash and cash equivalents (which cash, cash equivalents
and restricted cash amounted to $18.8 million as of March 31, 2021). As reflected in its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
herein, the Company has a history of losses, incurred a net loss of $41.8 million, and utilized cash of $9.5 million in operating activities
for the year ended March 31, 2021, and had a working capital deficiency of $15.7 million as of March 31, 2021. These factors, among others,
raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these financial
statements are filed. The Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company&rsquo;s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its growth strategy and on its ability to raise additional funds.
The Company filed a&nbsp;universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 which became effective in February 2019 to raise up to $150.0
million in cash from the sale of equity, debt and/or other financial instruments, of which $121.5 million is remaining. The continued
spread of COVID-19 and uncertain market conditions may limit the Company&rsquo;s ability to access capital, may reduce demand for its
services, and may negatively impact its ability to retain key personnel. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company sold 1,820,000
shares of its common stock to certain institutional investors for gross proceeds of $7.5 million.&nbsp;Management is currently seeking
additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate the Company&rsquo;s business. No
assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to
it. &nbsp;Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain terms that result in undue restrictions on its operations,
in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing.
The Company may also have to reduce certain overhead costs through the reduction of salaries and other means and settle liabilities through
negotiation. There can be no assurance that management&rsquo;s attempts at any or all of these endeavors will be successful.</P>

March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (&ldquo;COVID-19&rdquo;) as a pandemic.
The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets creating
increasing volatility and overall uncertainty. The Company began to experience modest adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the
fourth quarter of fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 and became more adverse throughout the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Although the
impact has subsided, the Company expects to continue experiencing modest adverse impacts throughout the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
The Company&rsquo;s event and programmatic advertising revenues were directly impacted throughout the 2021 fiscal year with all on-premise
in-person live music festivals and events postponed and mixed demand from historical advertising partners. Further, one of the Company&rsquo;s
larger customers also experienced a temporary halt to its production as a result of COVID-19, which negatively impacted the Company&rsquo;s
near-term subscriber growth in the 2021 fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company enacted several initiatives
to counteract these near-term challenges, including salary reductions, obtaining a Paycheck Protection Program loan (see Note 8 - Notes
Payable) and pivoting its live music production to 100% digital. The Company began producing, curating, and broadcasting digital music
festivals and events across its platform which has resulted in the growth in the number of live events streamed, related sponsorship revenue
and overall viewership. The Company also launched a new pay-per-view (&ldquo;PPV) offering in May 2020, enabling new forms of artist revenue
including digital tickets, tipping, digital meet and greet and merchandise sales. However, there is uncertainty as to the duration and
overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in an adverse material change in a future period to the Company&rsquo;s results
of operations, financial position and liquidity.</P>

changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses and technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax
depreciation of certain qualified improvement property. The Company evaluated the provisions of the CARES Act and does not anticipate
the associated impacts, if any, will have a material effect on its provision for income taxes.</P>

for Employee Retention Credits and does not anticipate the other provisions included will have a material impact on its provision for
income taxes.</P>

Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements in conformity with the United States of America (&ldquo;US&rdquo;) generally accepted
accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;) requires the Company&rsquo;s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include
revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, the assigned value of acquired assets and assumed and contingent liabilities associated with
business combinations and the related purchase price allocation, useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, intangible assets,
goodwill and other assets, inventory calculations and reserves, the fair value of the Company&rsquo;s equity-based compensation awards
and convertible debt and debenture instruments, fair values of derivatives, and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Given the overall uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19
pandemic, there is a reasonable possibility that actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could be material
to the financial position and results of operations, specifically in assessing when the collectability of revenue related consideration
is probable, and the impairment assessment of goodwill, indefinite lived assets or long-lived assets that are depreciated or amortized.</P>

contract with a customer when an approved contract exists, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the

when the Company satisfies its obligation by transferring control of the goods or services to its customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company uses the expected value
method to estimate the value of variable consideration on advertising and with original equipment manufacturer contracts to include in
the transaction price and reflect changes to such estimates in periods in which they occur. Variable consideration for these services
is allocated to and recognized over the related time period such advertising and subscription services are rendered as the amounts reflect
the consideration the Company is entitled to and relate specifically to the Company&rsquo;s efforts to satisfy its performance obligation.
The amount of variable consideration included in revenue is limited to the extent that it is probable that the amount will not be subject
to significant reversal when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.</P>

basis net of any sales tax from customers, when applicable. The determination of whether the Company acts as a principal or an agent in
a transaction is based on an evaluation of whether the Company controls the good or service prior to transfer to the customer. Where applicable,
the Company has determined that it acts as the principal in all of its subscription service, sponsorship, and merchandising streams and
may act as principal or agent for its ticketing/live events, advertising and licensing revenue streams.</P>

recognizes them in the period earned. Subscription revenue is recognized in the period of services rendered. The Company&rsquo;s subscription
revenue consists of performance obligations that are satisfied over time. This has been determined based on the fact that the nature of
services offered are subscription based where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the services provided regardless
of whether the customer uses the services or not. As a result, the Company has concluded that the best measure of progress toward the
complete satisfaction of the performance obligation over time is a time-based measure. The Company recognizes subscription revenue straight-line

mobile app services (collectively the &ldquo;Mobile Providers&rdquo;). For subscriptions sold through the Mobile Providers, the subscriber
executes an on-line agreement with Slacker outlining the terms and conditions between Slacker and the subscriber upon purchase of the
subscription. The Mobile Providers promote the Slacker app through their e-store, process payments for subscriptions, and retain a percentage
of revenue as a fee. The Company reports this revenue gross of the fee retained by the Mobile Providers, as the subscriber is Slacker&rsquo;s
customer in the contract and Slacker controls the service prior to the transfer to the subscriber. Subscription revenues from monthly
subscriptions sold directly through Mobile Providers are subject to such Mobile Providers&rsquo; refund or cancellation terms. Revenues
from Mobile Providers are recognized net of any such adjustments for variable consideration, including refunds and other fees. The Company&rsquo;s
payment terms vary based on whether the subscription is sold on a direct basis or through Mobile Providers. Subscriptions sold on a direct
basis require payment before the services are delivered to the customer. The payment terms for subscriptions sold through Mobile Providers
vary, but are generally payable within 30 days.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Stock-based compensation cost
is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which
is the vesting period, on an accelerated basis. The Company accounts for awards with graded vesting as if each vesting tranche is valued
as a separate award. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock options.
This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and the expected term of the stock options which are highly complex
and subjective variables. The variables take into consideration, among other things, actual and projected employee stock option exercise
behavior. The Company uses a predicted volatility of its stock price during the expected life of the options that is based on the historical
performance of the Company&rsquo;s stock price as well as including an estimate using guideline companies. The expected term is computed
using the simplified method as the Company&rsquo;s best estimate given its lack of actual exercise history. The Company has selected a
risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected term of the
stock. Compensation expense resulting from granted restricted stock units and restricted stock awards is measured at fair value on the
date of grant and is recognized as share-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting period. Stock-based awards are comprised
principally of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (&ldquo;RSUs&rdquo;), and restricted stock awards (&ldquo;RSAs&rdquo;).&nbsp;Forfeitures

taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Company&rsquo;s

business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting where the purchase consideration is allocated to the underlying net tangible
and intangible assets acquired, based on their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair
values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest
in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Additionally, any contingent consideration is recorded
at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the
acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis
of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and
noncontrolling interests requires management&rsquo;s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including,
but not limited to, the selection of appropriate valuation methodology, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows, weighted average cost
of capital, discount rates, estimates of customer turnover rates, estimates of terminal values, and royalty rates.</P>

whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment
is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If a quantitative test is
performed, we determine the fair value of the related reporting unit and compare this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting
unit, including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting unit is determined using a market approach based on quoted prices in active
markets. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, an impairment charge
is recorded. Based on our annual impairment assessment, no impairments of goodwill were identified in the fiscal years ended March 31,

price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on
the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). The Company uses the three-level valuation hierarchy for classification of fair value measurements.
The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Inputs may be observable
or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company&rsquo;s own
assumptions about the data market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available
in the circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below:</P>

that some entities may have applied the guidance being amended in an inconsistent manner. The inconsistent application of the guidance
may result in some entities changing their current accounting practices and financial statement reporting. Therefore, the FASB is providing
transition guidance for all the amendments in this ASU. The amendments in Sections B and C of this ASU are effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2020, for public business entities. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application of the
amendments in this ASU is permitted for public business entities for any annual or interim period for which financial statements have

statements are available to be issued. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively. An entity should apply the amendments

Company converted accounts payable into a Promissory Note (the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;) in the aggregate principal amount of $0.2 million.
The Note bears interest at 6% per annum and interest is payable on a quarterly basis commencing March 31, 2015 or the Company may elect
that the amount of such interest be added to the principal sum outstanding under this Note. The payables arose in connection with professional
services rendered by attorneys for the Company prior to and through December 31, 2014, and the Note had an original maturity date of December
31, 2015, which was extended to September 30, 2016 or such later date as the lender may agree to in writing. In February 2018, the Note
holder filed a claim for collection of the Note (see Note 15 &ndash; Commitments and Contingencies). In February 2019, as part of a settlement
agreement, the parties agreed to the repayment of the Note on or before June 30, 2019. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Note
has not been extended and is currently past due. In addition, the holder of the Note obtained a judgement against the Company for nonpayment
of the Note in the State of Delaware in August 2019 and a judgement lien against the Company in the State of California in the third fiscal
quarter ended December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance due under the Note was $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively,
which includes $0.1 million and $0.1 million of accrued interest, respectively.</P>

funds requires the Company to, in good faith, certify that the current economic uncertainty made the loan request necessary to support
the ongoing operations of the Company. This certification further requires the Company to consider its current business activity and its
ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental
to the business. The receipt of these funds, and the forgiveness of the loan attendant to these funds, is dependent on the Company having
initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on its future adherence to the forgiveness criteria.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On April 10, 2018, Joseph&nbsp;Schnaier,
Danco Enterprises, LLC (an entity solely owned by Mr.&nbsp;Schnaier, &ldquo;Danco&rdquo;), Wantmcs Holdings, LLC (Mr.&nbsp;Schnaier&nbsp;is
the managing member) and Wantickets (Mr.&nbsp;Schnaier is the 90% beneficial owner) filed a&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York against each of the Company, LXL Tickets, Robert S. Ellin, Alec Ellin, Blake Indursky and Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. (&ldquo;Computershare&rdquo;). Plaintiffs subsequently voluntarily dismissed all claims against Alec Ellin and Blake
Indursky. The&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;alleged multiple causes of action arising out of&nbsp;Schnaier&rsquo;s investment (through Danco) of
$1.25 million into the Company in 2016, the Company&rsquo;s purchase of certain operating assets of Wantickets pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of May 5, 2017, and Mr.&nbsp;Schnaier&rsquo;s employment with LXL Tickets, including claims for fraudulent inducement,
breach of contract, conversion, and defamation. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs have also&nbsp;sued&nbsp;Computershare
for negligence and for injunctive relief relating to the refusal to transfer certain restricted shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
owned by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief, damages of approximately $26.7 million, plus interest, attorneys&rsquo;
fees and costs and other such relief as the court may award. The Company has denied plaintiffs&rsquo; claims. The Company believes that
the&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;is an intentional act by the plaintiffs to publicly tarnish the Company&rsquo;s and its senior management&rsquo;s
reputations through the public domain in an effort to obtain by threat of litigation certain results for Mr.&nbsp;Schnaier&rsquo;s self-serving
and improper purposes.&nbsp;The Company is vigorously defending this&nbsp;lawsuit, and the Company believes that the allegations are without
merit and that it has strong defenses. On June 26, 2018, the Company and LXL Tickets, filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs for breach
of contract (including under the Asset Purchase Agreement), fraudulent inducement, and other causes of action, seeking injunctive relief,
damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses and such other relief as the court may award.&nbsp;The parties are currently engaged in pre-trial
proceedings, including continuing discovery efforts with the trial not expected to commence, if any, until the Company&rsquo;s fiscal
year ending March 31, 2022 (unless further delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). In October 2018, pursuant to the terms of the
APA, the Company submitted a formal demand to Wantickets, Mr. Schnaier and Danco to indemnify the Company, among other things, for its
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this matter. As of March 31, 2021, all of plaintiffs&rsquo; claims other than fraudulent
inducement and breach of the employment agreement have been dismissed or addressed by the parties or the court. While a trial date has
not yet been set, the Company expects to commence trial sometime during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. The Company intends to continue
to vigorously defend all defendants against any liability to the plaintiffs with respect to the remaining claims. As of March 31, 2021,
while the Company has assessed the likelihood of a loss, if any, is not probable, the outcome of this lawsuit is inherently uncertain
and the potential range of loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s business, financial condition and results
of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In April 2018, the Company
granted 1,150,000 restricted stock units to 2 key executives. In FY21 (&ldquo;the Modification Date&rdquo;), the Board of Directors approved
an amendment to the key executives&rsquo; employment agreement which modified the vesting terms associated with these awards. The modified
vesting terms approved by the Board of Directors, which modified the number of shares issued and the timing of vesting, resulted in an
additional 464,557 units probable of vesting as of the Modification Date. This resulted in incremental share-based compensation expense
of $0.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2021.</P>

The timing, price, and quantity of purchases under the program will be at the discretion of our management and will depend upon a variety
of factors including share price, general and business market conditions, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, corporate and
regulatory requirements, and alternative uses of capital. The program may be expanded, suspended, or discontinued by our board of directors
at any time. Although our board of directors has authorized this stock repurchase program, there is no guarantee as to the exact number
of shares, if any, that will be repurchased by us, and we may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional
purchases are not warranted. We cannot guarantee that the program will be consummated, fully or all, or that it will enhance long-term
stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our common stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination
of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, this program could diminish our cash reserves.</P>

had available federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income of approximately $113 million and $78.7
million, respectively.&nbsp;The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire on various dates beginning in 2024.
Of the $113 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, $54.1 million was generated in tax years beginning before March 31, 2018
and is subject to the 20-year carryforward period (&ldquo;pre-Tax Act losses&rdquo;), the remaining $58.9 million (&ldquo;post-Tax Act

year thereafter.&nbsp; The Company has estimated a limitation and revalued the losses and credits at $22 million and $0, respectively.&nbsp;
It is possible that the utilization of these NOL carryforwards and tax credits may be further limited. The Company will undertake a study
to determine the applicable limitations, if any.&nbsp;Upon the attainment of taxable income by the Company, management will assess the
likelihood of realizing the tax benefit associated with the use of the carryforwards and will recognize the appropriate deferred tax asset
at that time.&nbsp;</P>

Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined
in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our Company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of our Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
(iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.</P>

to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>
