      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt;">Certain statements contained in this Annual Report are forward-looking in nature. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team&#8217;s
        expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are
        forward-looking statements. The words &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;possible,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;predict,&#8221; &#8220;project,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and similar expressions may identify

        assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual
        results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described below under &#8220;Summary of Risk Factors&#8221; and
        in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these
        forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 7, 2020 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,
        reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor
        has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target. <font style="color: #000000;">We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we
          will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.&#160; We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents in the form of specified U.S. government treasury bills or
          specified money market funds. B</font><font style="color: #000000;">ased on our business activities, we are a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, because we have no operations and
          our assets consist almost entirely of cash and cash equivalents.</font></div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our management team is led by Jeffrey Luhnow (Chair and Co-CEO), Tavo Hellmund (Co-CEO and director), and Timothy W. Clark (CFO, COO and director) who bring a combination of strategic, operational,
        financial and transactional experience paired with a track record of creating significant value. We believe our founders&#8217; collective expertise will make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, and will bring unique value creation
        opportunities through their networks.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have assembled an experienced team of advisors, or industry advisors, to assist in the sourcing, evaluation, due diligence, deal execution, and post-closing strategic involvement with potential
        business combination partners. Our strategy, as further described below, is predicated on finding a business combination partner where we can define and present to our investors a clear, executable plan to drive long-term stockholder value creation
        through our collective experience. We believe the operational and financial expertise of our industry advisors is a differentiating element of our approach, which gives us the opportunity to pursue potential business combination targets in several
        industry sectors where we have expertise, and increases our likelihood of finding and completing a suitable business combination. We believe that having highly experienced industry advisors from multiple sectors increases the potential for a
        successful initial business combination, giving us a distinct advantage. Our industry advisors are R.C. Buford, James Carney, Art Chou, and Hugh Forrest.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to focus on a target within the sports and related sectors. Examples of areas that the team intends to focus on
        include sports franchises, media, data analytics, and technology and services businesses serving those end markets, among others. Our founders have extensive experience in these areas and we believe a business operating in one of these areas would
        benefit from our operational expertise and the networks of our management team.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our sponsor is JTJT Partners LLC. On December 11, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 3,593,750 Class B common stock, or founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, resulting
        in an effective purchase price per founder share of approximately $0.007.<font style="color: #000000;"> In February 2021, our sponsor sold 10,000 founder shares to each of Sashi Brown, Endre Holen, Joyce C. Johnson and Sebastian Park, our
          independent directors (for a total of 40,000 founder shares), for an aggregate purchase price of $69.57, resulting in an effective purchase price per share of approximately $0.007. In February 2021, our sponsor sold 2,500 founder shares to each
          of R.C. Buford, Art Chou and Hugh Forrest, our industry advisors (for a total of 7,500 founder shares), for an aggregate purchase price of $17.39, resulting in an effective purchase price per share of approximately $0.007. On February 16, 2021,
          we effected a stock dividend of 718,750 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares, or approximately 20% of our issued and outstanding shares immediately
          after our IPO.</font></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On February 19, 2021, we consummated our IPO offering 17,250,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant.
        Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one public share at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,950,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable
        to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, to our sponsor and certain directors and advisors of the Company, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant. Only whole warrants are exercisable. The
        warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12 months from the closing of our IPO, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or
        earlier upon redemption or liquidation. We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination, payable in cash,
        subject to the limitations. If we have not completed our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO, we will redeem 100% of the public shares, payable in cash, subject to applicable law.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We received gross proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants of $172,500,000 and $5,950,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $178,450,000. $172,500,000 of the gross
        proceeds from the IPO and private placement (which includes the underwriter&#8217;s deferred discount of $6,037,500) were deposited in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company as trustee.&#160; As of the closing of our IPO, $5,950,000
        was held outside of the trust account, of which $3,450,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts, $796,711 was used to pay other offering costs, and $49,958 was used to repay a note payable to our sponsor. The balance held outside of the trust
        account is reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in
        U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the
        trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of
        incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24
        months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our initial
        business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our
        public stockholders.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our units commenced public trading on February 17, 2021 on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq under the symbol &#8220;SPTKU.&#8221;&#160; We expect our Class A common stock and our warrants to begin trading
        separately on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols &#8220;SPTK&#8221; and &#8220;SPTKW&#8221; respectively on April 9, 2021.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe that the global sports and related industries represent an attractive market opportunity as they are expected to continue to grow and evolve. There are a number of sectors related to the
        broader sports ecosystems that have developed rapidly to enhance the fan experience, improve performance and to drive results. In addition to leagues and teams, the universe of sports-related companies includes brands that target sports fans and
        participants, content creators, entertainment product providers, data analytics, athletes and organizations catering to all levels from youth to amateur to professional. The breadth of the sports-related ecosystem and addressable market is
        significant with a substantial number of companies across the diverse geographies, alternative sports types, and emerging technologies. Significant amounts of historical capital availability throughout the sports ecosystem has helped drive
        transaction volume and the availability of future targets of scale.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The global pandemic has greatly affected the sports and related industries as fans have not been able to attend live events, which has resulted in dramatic game day revenue declines. However, the
        industries have shown remarkable resilience and ability to pivot in the face of strong headwinds. While the in-person experience will always be a valuable component for any fan, we believe the industries can survive, and even thrive, being
        delivered into homes and on-the-go to devices through continued innovation and the use of technology.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe this represents an opportunity, as a major impact of the pandemic was organizations having to quickly reduce costs and improve efficiencies. In addition, the need to evolve has
        accelerated the value and impact of science, technology, and world class operations that has created attractive opportunities for new sports and related products and services. Some examples of these opportunities include: utilization of technology
        to drive operational efficiencies, increasing opportunities for data monetization, adoption of technology solutions to improve performance, and increasing sponsorship and partnership opportunities between participants in the sports ecosystem, among
        others. We believe our team is uniquely positioned to recognize those opportunities and utilize our networks to capitalize on these trends in a post-pandemic world.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">None of our industry advisors are officers or directors of our company and therefore owe us no fiduciary duties as such. While we expect that they will assist us in identifying business combination
        targets, they have no obligation <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg6"></a>to do so and may devote a substantial portion of their business time to activities unrelated to us. Our industry advisors may have fiduciary, contractual or other
        obligations or duties to other organizations to present business combination opportunities to such other organizations rather than to us. Accordingly, if any industry advisor becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for
        one or more entities to which he has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, such industry advisor will honor those obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first and only present it to
        us if such entities reject the opportunity and such industry advisor determines to present the opportunity to us.</div>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Initial Business Combination</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Nasdaq rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust
        account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned in the trust account). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of
        directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our
        board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the
        board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of
        our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an
        opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated
        industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding
        equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business
        in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting
        securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company
        Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction
        company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
        capital stock of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result
        of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100%
        of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes
        of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses
        together as the initial business combination for the purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe our management team&#8217;s and our industry advisors&#8217; significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential
        business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and our industry advisors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe this network provides us with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which are proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the
        sale process. We believe that this network of contacts and relationships will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition,<a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg7"></a> we anticipate that target business candidates will
        be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, its members, or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete
        our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, its members, or our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment
        banking firm or from an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">As discussed above and in &#8220;Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance &#8211; Conflicts of Interests&#8221; if our sponsor, any of its members, or any of our officers, directors or
        industry advisors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for one or more entities to which it, he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, it, he or she will honor these obligations and duties
        to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us (including as described above). In addition, we
        may, at our option, pursue an affiliated joint acquisition opportunity with an entity to which our sponsor, any of its members, or an officer or director has a fiduciary, contractual or other obligation or duty. Any such parties may co-invest with
        us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such parties. In addition, our industry advisors shall have no
        obligation to present a business combination opportunity to us, even if they do not have a duty to present such opportunity to any other entity and/or if such other entities have rejected the opportunity.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Status as a Public Company</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional
        initial public offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the
        target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a
        public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses
        incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter&#8217;s
        ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of
        providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#8217; interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or
        the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being
        required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements
        and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a
        result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities, and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
          Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend
          to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total
        annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that
        year&#8217;s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Additionally, we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations,
        including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates
        equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year&#8217;s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals
        or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year&#8217;s second fiscal quarter.</div>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg8"></a>Financial Position</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $172,500,000 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $<font style="color: #000000;">6,037,500 </font>of deferred
        underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt
        ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the
        consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Effecting our Initial Business Combination</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of
        our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company
        or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
        business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction
        businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our officers, and other members of our management team are from time to time made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business
        combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction with us. Additionally, we have not,
        nor has anyone on our behalf, taken any substantive measure, directly or indirectly, to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate for us, nor have we engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any such
        acquisition candidate.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may seek to raise additional funds in connection with the completion of our initial business combination through a private offering of equity securities (including pursuant to a specified future
        issuance) or debt securities or loans, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offerings or loans rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would
        disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately
        (including pursuant to a specified future issuance) or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any
        additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.</div>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Nasdaq rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust
        account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned in the trust account). The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards
        generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we
        will <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg9"></a>obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not
        currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually
        unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with
        nominal operations.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
        acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business
        or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors to
        evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous
        risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document
        reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently
        ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring
        losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Lack of business diversification</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may
        have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our
        assessment of the target business&#8217;s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our
        management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg10"></a>of our directors or industry advisors will remain associated in some
        capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is highly unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our
        management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the post-business combination company. The determination as to whether any of our key
        personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the
        ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.</div>

        rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, industry advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our
        initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to
        material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public
        shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions
        for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they
        are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder
        of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.</div>

        already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote
        against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the
        going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the
        initial business combination, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3) satisfy a closing
        condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such

        proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only
        potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to
        acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the
        amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg12"></a>with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price,
        payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes
        payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not
        withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the
        underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with
        respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares
        held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either: (1)
        in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a
        proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically
        require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
        would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve
        the proposed business combination. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock
        exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the
        redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business
        combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
        company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination.
        These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of
        whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares
        and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation&#160; provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001
        following such redemptions. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business
        combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in
        accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to
        satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg14"></a>of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares,
        all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
        combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in
        concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the &#8220;Excess Shares,&#8221; without
        our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our
        sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our
        IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By
        limiting our stockholders&#8217; ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business
        combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#8217; ability to
        vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.</div>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our
        transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy
        materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination at the holder&#8217;s option.
        The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery
        requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close
        of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to
        the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However,
        we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively
        short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC
        (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would
        be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery
        must be effectuated.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies
        would distribute <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg15"></a>proxy materials for the stockholders&#8217; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card
        indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As
        a result, the stockholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she
        could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting,
        would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#8217;s
        election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholder
        meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and
        subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed
        to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their
        shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.</div>

        our initial business combination within such period or during any extension period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
        redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay
        dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and
        (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for
        claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination
        within the prescribed time period.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account
        with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates then hold any
        public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time frame.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to
        modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
        closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg16"></a>activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity
        to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes
        payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of proceeds held outside
        the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent
        that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account
        interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust
        account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be
        substantially less than $10.00. Please see &#8220;Item 1A.&#160; Risk Factors - <font style="font-style: italic;">If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received
          by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share</font>&#8221; and other risk factors described below. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in
        full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay
        such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors&#8217; claims.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do
        business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or
        even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims
        challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such
        claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such
        third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose
        particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In
        addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account
        for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target
        business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date
        of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and
        all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver
        is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its
        indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&#8217;s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg17"></a>satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to
        reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial
        business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any
        redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the
        liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification
        obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently
        expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to
        do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely.
        Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per public share. Please see &#8220;Item 1A.&#160; Risk Factors - <font style="font-style: italic;">If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share</font>&#8221; and other risk factors described

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our
        independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
        Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust
        account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
        law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Sections 280 and 281 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party
        claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of
        stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred with respect to
        any actions, suits or proceedings initiated after the third anniversary of the dissolution.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business
        combination within the required time period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims
        of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg18"></a>distribution. If we have not completed our initial business
        combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or during any extension period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
        redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay
        dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and
        (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for
        claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our acquisition period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply
        with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such
        date.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing
        and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for
        prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our
        underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us
        waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust
        account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
        account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed
        a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an
        executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.</div>

        return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under
        applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of
        directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior
        to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors <font style="font-style: italic;">- If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust

        with those public shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem; (2) the redemption <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_108-bus_pg19"></a>of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and

        completed our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event
        we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#8217;s voting in connection with our initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), public
        companies, financial buyers, strategic buyers, other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing
        services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of
        these competitors. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of
        certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. Our sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in us, although our sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation or other duty to
        do so. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights
        may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a
        competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial business combination.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We currently maintain our executive offices at 2200 S. Utica Place, Suite 450, Tulsa, OK 74114. The cost for this space is included in the $2,000 per month fee that we will pay our sponsor for
        office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to
        devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote
        in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. Our industry advisors are not officers or directors of
        the company, and are not obligated to devote any time to our business and affairs.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and, as a result, we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and
        current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.&#160; We have no current intention
        of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000;">The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at
        http://www.sec.gov.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to
        assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international
        financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public
        Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time
        for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do
        not believe that this limitation will be material.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large
        accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial
        reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; font-style: italic;">An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in
        this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our
        securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Risks Related to Our Operating History</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We are a recently incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are a recently incorporated company with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through our IPO. Because we lack an operating history, you have no
        basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business
        concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Past performance by members of our management team and our industry advisors may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of
        any business we may acquire.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Information regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, members of our management team and our industry advisors is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience and
        performance, including related to acquisitions, of members of our management team and our industry advisors is not a guarantee either: (1) that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination; or
        (2) of any results with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record and performance of members of our management team and our industry advisors as indicative of the future performance
        of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. Our management team, our industry advisors, and their respective affiliates have had limited past experience with blank check and special purpose acquisition
        companies.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Risks Related to Our Potential Initial Business Combination</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination
        even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may not hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination unless the business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing
        requirements or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or
        will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would
        otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our outstanding public shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. Please see
        &#8220;Item 1.&#160; Business <font style="font-style: italic;">-Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination</font>&#8221; for additional information.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination,
        regardless of how our public stockholders vote.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial
        business combination. Our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees currently own approximately 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more
        likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees agreed to vote their founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public
        stockholders.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us
        for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of such business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Additionally, since our board of directors may
        complete a business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination. Accordingly, if we do not seek stockholder approval, your only opportunity to
        affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our
        public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it
        difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
        If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions
        payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with a business combination and such amount of deferred underwriting discount is not available for us to use as consideration in an initial business
        combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be
        contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to
        satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target). Prospective
        targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. If we are able to consummate an initial business combination, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming
        stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business
        combination or optimize our capital structure.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights and, therefore, we will need to structure
        the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or
        requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for
        redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive
        equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg3"></a>The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the
        probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing,
        the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful increases. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If
        you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a
        material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a
        business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial
        business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
        closing of our IPO. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to
        complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the end of the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial
        business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
        up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO. We may not be able to find a suitable target
        business and complete our initial business combination within such time period. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the
        other risks described herein, including as a result of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of infectious diseases. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally and, while the
        extent of the impact of the outbreak on us will depend on future developments, it could limit our ability to complete our initial business combination, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party
        financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) may negatively impact
        businesses we may seek to acquire. It may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this &#8220;<font style="font-style: italic;">Risk Factors</font>&#8221; section, such as those related to the market for our securities and
        cross-border transactions.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period or during any extension period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as

        shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on business and debt and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our search for a business combination, and any target
        business with which we ultimately complete a business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization
        declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a &#8220;Public Health Emergency of International Concern.&#8221; On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S.
        healthcare community in responding to the coronavirus, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a &#8220;pandemic.&#8221; The pandemic, together with resulting voluntary and U.S. federal and state and non-U.S.
        governmental actions, including, without limitation, mandatory business closures, public gathering limitations, restrictions on travel and quarantines, has meaningfully disrupted the global economy and markets. Although the long-term economic
        fallout of COVID-19 is difficult to predict, it has had and is expected to continue to have ongoing material adverse effects across many, if not all, aspects of the regional, national and global economy. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted, and a
        significant outbreak of other infectious diseases could result, in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we complete a
        business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential
        investors or the target company&#8217;s personnel, and vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and complete a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our search for a business combination will
        depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among
        others. If the disruptions posed by the coronavirus or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete a business combination, or the operations of a
        target business with which we ultimately complete a business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In addition, our ability to complete a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing, which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events, including as a result of
        increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may enter into certain
        transactions, including purchasing shares or warrants from the public, which may influence the outcome of our proposed business combination and reduce the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our securities.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our
        sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
        completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation or other duty to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such public stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is
        no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated
        transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling public stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The price per share paid in any such
        transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business
        combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide
        them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
        transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg5"></a>transactions. Please see &#8220;Item 1. Business <font style="font-style: italic;">- Permitted purchases and other transactions with
          respect to our securities</font>&#8221; for a description of how such persons will determine from which stockholders to enter into transactions with. The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the initial business
        combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for
        approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business
        combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.</div>

        difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for
        tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules,
        if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the tender offer documents or proxy materials, as applicable, that we
        will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. For example, we may require our
        public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer or
        proxy materials documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the
        transfer agent electronically. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. Please see &#8220;Item 1. Business<font style="font-style: italic;"> &#8211; Tendering stock certificates in connection with a

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced
        to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination, and then only in
        connection with those shares of Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to
        amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
        complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our
        public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. Public stockholders who redeem their Class A common stock in connection
        with a stockholder vote described in clause (2) in the preceding sentence will not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial
        business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, with respect to such Class A common stock so redeemed. In addition, if we have not completed an initial business combination within the required time period for any reason,
        compliance with Delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our trust account. In that case, public stockholders may be forced to
        wait beyond the end of such period before they receive funds from our trust account. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right
        to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.</div>

        securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our units are listed on Nasdaq and our Class A common stock and warrants will be listed on or promptly after their date of separation on April 9, 2021. We cannot assure you that our securities will
        continue to be, listed on Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock
        price levels. In general. we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 public stockholders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with
        Nasdaq&#8217;s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq&#8217;s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, in order for our Class A common stock to be listed
        upon the consummation of our initial business combination, at such time, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our stockholders&#8217; equity would be required to be at least $4,000,000 and we would be required to
        have at least 300 round lot holders (with at least 50% of such round lot holders holding securities with a market value of at least $2,500). We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted
        on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:</div>

        &#8220;covered securities.&#8221; Because our units and on or promptly after their date of separation on April 9, 2021 our Class A common stock and warrants will be listed on Nasdaq, our units, Class A common stock and warrants will qualify as covered
        securities under such statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of
        fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies,
        other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states.

        of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the &#8220;Excess Shares,&#8221; without our prior consent. However, our amended and restated
        certificate of incorporation does not restrict our stockholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence
        over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with
        respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your stock in open
        market transactions, potentially at a loss.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business
        combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our redemption of their stock, and our warrants will expire
        worthless.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other
        blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and
        effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and
        our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the
        private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. Our sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional
        investments in us, although our sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation or other duty to do so. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our
        obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they
        potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing an initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our
        initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. Please see &#8220;<font style="font-style: italic;">-If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share</font>&#8221; and other risk

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If the funds not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 24 months following the closing of our IPO, we may be unable to
        complete our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 24 months following the closing of our IPO, assuming that our initial business
        combination is not completed during that time. We expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. Management&#8217;s plans to <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg8"></a>address this need for capital through our IPO and potential
        loans from certain of our affiliates are discussed in the section of this Annual Report titled &#8220;<font style="font-style: italic;">Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</font>.&#8221; However, our affiliates
        are not obligated to make loans to us in the future, and we may not be able to raise additional financing from unaffiliated parties necessary to fund our expenses. Any such event in the future may negatively impact the analysis regarding our
        ability to continue as a going concern at such time.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 24 months following the closing of our IPO; however, we cannot
        assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down
        payment or to fund a &#8220;no-shop&#8221; provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from &#8220;shopping&#8221; around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target
        businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were
        subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a prospective target business. If we are unable to
        complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. Please see &#8220;<font style="font-style: italic;">-If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share</font>&#8221; and other risk

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available to fund
        our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search, to pay our taxes and to complete our initial business combination. If
        we are unable to obtain such loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, only approximately $ 1,653,331was initially available to us outside of the trust account. If we are required to seek
        additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their respective affiliates is under
        any obligation or other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us in such circumstances. Any such loans may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. If
        we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In such case, our public stockholders may receive only $10.00
        per share, or less in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. Please see &#8220; <font style="font-style: italic;">- If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with a
        particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these
        factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks,
        unexpected risks may arise and <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg9"></a>previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an
        immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants
        to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a stockholder or
        warrant holder following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust
        account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware
        law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Sections 280 and 281 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party
        claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of
        stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred with respect to
        any actions, suits or proceedings initiated after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month from the closing of our IPO (or the end of
        any extension period) in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Because we do not intend to comply with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all
        existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to
        searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, consultants, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with
        Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the
        stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for
        any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public
        stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution
        is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating
        distribution.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Because we are neither limited to evaluating target businesses in a particular industry, sector or geographic area nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in any industry or sector, including the sports, media, and data analytics sectors. However, we will not, under our amended
        and restated certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached any specific
        target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business&#8217;s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg10"></a>the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially
        unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors
        will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence.
        Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will
        ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a stockholder or warrant holder
        following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may seek acquisition opportunities in acquisition targets that may be outside of our management&#8217;s areas of expertise.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We will consider a business combination outside of our management&#8217;s areas of expertise if such business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an
        attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management&#8217;s expertise, our management&#8217;s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the
        information contained in this prospectus regarding the areas of our management&#8217;s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or
        assess all of the significant risk factors relevant to such acquisition. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a stockholder or warrant holder following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in
        the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business
        combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and
        guidelines.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business
        combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination
        with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may
        exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the
        transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the
        target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the
        liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may seek acquisition opportunities with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings, which could

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">To the extent we complete our initial business combination with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be

        intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all

        common stock available, respectively, for issuance, which amount takes into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants but not upon the conversion of the Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are
        automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein. Immediately

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require
        substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely
        would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will
        result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public

        our search for a business combination and their other responsibilities. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our business combination. Each of our officers and directors is engaged in several other business
        endeavors for which he or she may be entitled to substantial compensation and our officers and directors are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and/or
        board members for other entities. If our officers&#8217; and directors&#8217; other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our operations following a business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to the sports, media and data analytics sector. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these
        risks will likely not affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific industry in which we operate or target businesses which we acquire, none of which can be presently ascertained.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business
        combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and
        officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In
        order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any
        failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination&#8217;s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to
        have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (&#8220;run-off
        insurance&#8221;). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg14"></a>Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the
        efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot
        presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination, there is no certainty that any of them will do so. While we
        intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of
        operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In addition, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination target&#8217;s key personnel
        could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate&#8217;s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we
        contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate&#8217;s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition
        candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business
        combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may cause our key personnel to have conflicts of interest in determining whether to proceed with a particular business combination. However,
        there is no certainty that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in
        connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our
        securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel&#8217;s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial
        interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination will not be
        the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination, as there is no certainty that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initial business
        combination.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Members of our management team have significant experience as founders, board members, officers or executives of other companies or organizations. As a result, certain of those

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">During the course of their careers, members of our management team have had significant experience as founders, board members, officers or executives of other companies or organizations. As a
        result of their involvement and positions in these companies or organizations, some members of our management team have been, and may in the future be, involved in litigation, investigations, proceedings, negative publicity or other events arising
        out of or relating to the operations of such companies or organizations or transactions entered into by such companies or organizations. For example, after a lengthy investigation by the Major League Baseball, or MLB, into allegations of sign
        stealing by the Houston Astros during the 2016 through 2018 seasons, in January 2020, MLB determined that the Houston Astros had violated MLB rules by engaging in sign stealing during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. At the conclusion of its
        investigation in January 2020, MLB imposed a one season suspension of Jeffrey Luhnow, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. The Houston Astros subsequently terminated Mr. Luhnow as President of Baseball Operations and General Manager. Mr. Luhnow filed a
        complaint against the Houston Astros for breach of contract and the case was dismissed after the parties resolved their differences. Involvement of one or more members of our management in litigation, <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg15"></a>investigations,



        proceedings or negative publicity may be detrimental to our reputation and could materially impact our ability to identify and complete our initial business combination, including as a result of perception of target businesses, as well as divert
        our management team&#8217;s attention and resources away from identifying and consummating our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business, which may increase the probability that we enter into an initial business combination
        with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business&#8217;s management may be limited due to a
        lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target&#8217;s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target&#8217;s
        management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who
        choose to remain a stockholder or warrant holder following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination target&#8217;s key personnel could
        negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate&#8217;s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we
        contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate&#8217;s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition
        candidate will not wish to remain in place.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our officers or directors which may
        raise potential conflicts of interest.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In light of the involvement of our sponsor, its members, and our officers and directors with other businesses, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with or competitive with
        our sponsor, any of its members, our officers or directors and their respective affiliates. Our directors also serve as officers and/or board members for other entities. Such entities and entities affiliated with our sponsor and its members, may
        compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there
        have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a
        transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an
        independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm, regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our
        sponsor, officers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they
        may hold), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On December 11, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 3,593,750 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, resulting in an effective purchase price per founder share of
        approximately $0.007.<font style="color: #000000;"> On February 16, 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 718,750 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder
          shares. </font>Additionally, members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities following our IPO, including founder shares, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular
        target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In addition, our sponsor and certain of our independent directors and industry advisors purchased an aggregate of 5,950,000&#160; private placement warrants for a purchase price of $5,950,000, or $1.00
        per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete our initial business combination. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to
        adjustment.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The founder shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the units sold in our IPO, except that: (1) prior to our initial business combination, only holders of the Class B common
        stock have the right to vote on the election of directors and holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock may remove members of our board of directors for any reason; (2) our initial stockholders, officers and
        directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive: (a) their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial
        business combination, (b) their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (I) to modify
        the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
        of our IPO or (II) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (c) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held
        by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail
        to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame); (3) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions; (4) the founder shares are automatically convertible into shares of our&#160; Class A common stock at
        the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights; and (5) the holders of founder shares are entitled to registration rights.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The personal and financial interests of our sponsor, its members, and our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination,
        completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the deadline for completing our initial business combination nears.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial
        condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders&#8217; investment in us.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination and affiliates of our management could potentially provide or arrange such financing. We have agreed that we
        will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount
        available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:</div>

        effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which
        we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and
        give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on
        the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks,
        including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and
        services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg18"></a>Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide
        assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own less than 100% of the outstanding equity
        interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling
        interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company
        owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations
        ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, or
        issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of
        new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently
        combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&#8217;s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the
        target business.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with
        which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event may we redeem our public shares in an amount that would
        cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. As a result, we may be
        able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination
        and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of
        their respective affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the
        terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders
        thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments, including
        their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants,
        amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business
        combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination. To the extent any such amendment would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of our securities, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the
        affected securities.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg19"></a>Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity
        (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least 65% of our outstanding common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of
        some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our
        stockholders may not support.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company&#8217;s pre-business combination
        activity, without approval by holders of a certain percentage of the company&#8217;s stockholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by holders holding between 90% and 100% of the company&#8217;s public shares. Our
        amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants into the
        trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65% of our outstanding common stock, and
        corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65% of our outstanding common stock. Unless specified in our amended and restated certificate of
        incorporation or bylaws, or as required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock that are voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our stockholders,
        and, prior to our initial business combination, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock is required to approve the election or removal of directors. We may not issue additional securities
        that can vote pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation on any initial business combination or any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our initial stockholders, who beneficially own
        approximately 20% of our common stock, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to
        amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete our initial
        business combination with which you do not agree.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the
        substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our
        IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon
        approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in a letter agreement
        that we have entered into with our sponsor, officers and directors. Our public stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor,
        officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our public stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Although we believe that the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not
        yet selected any target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our
        initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial
        business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing (including pursuant to a specified future issuance) or to abandon
        the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg20"></a>acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed
        to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, even if we do not need
        additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the
        continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our
        initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination
        with some prospective target businesses.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial
        statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be
        required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. These financial statement
        requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and
        complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than
        $10.00 per share.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent
        registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the
        benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent
        inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held
        in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement
        with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our
        acquisition proposal less attractive to them and, to the extent prospective target businesses refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential target businesses that we might pursue. Examples of possible instances where we may
        engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to
        execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out
        of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not completed our initial business combination within the prescribed
        timeframe, or upon the <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg22"></a>exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may
        be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such
        creditors.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we
        have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of
        the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek
        access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be
        unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations
        and believe that our sponsor&#8217;s only assets are securities of our company. Our sponsor may not have sufficient funds available to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations, and therefore, no funds are
        currently set aside to cover any such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per
        public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will
        indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The securities in which we invest the proceeds held in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the interest income available for payment of
        taxes or reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The net proceeds of our IPO and certain proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants, in the amount of $172,500,000, are held in an interest-bearing trust account. The proceeds held in
        the trust account may only be invested in direct U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in certain money market funds which invest only in direct U.S. Treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury
        obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the
        Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event of very low or negative yields, the amount of interest income (which we may withdraw to pay taxes, if any) would
        be reduced. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders are entitled to receive their share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income. If the balance of the trust
        account is reduced below $172,500,000 as a result of negative interest rates, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account
        available for distribution to our public stockholders.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date
        of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that
        it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our
        independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain
        instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If our independent
        directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.</div>

        amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing

        measures we take to manage threats to our business, our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of such threats in light of advances in computer capabilities, new and sophisticated
        methods used by cybercriminals including phishing, social engineering or other illicit acts, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to adequately mitigate. In March 2021, we determined that we were the victim of
        criminal fraud known to law enforcement authorities as business e-mail compromise fraud which involved social engineering to cause employees to wire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken belief that the requests were made by a company executive
        or an established vendor. The fraud resulted in transfers of funds aggregating approximately $700,000 to the perpetrator. We managed to recover the funds but these and other cyberattacks and scams could cause us to suffer material financial and

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States
        &#8220;government securities&#8221; within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg24"></a>market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
        promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of
        the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to
        avoid being deemed an &#8220;investment company&#8221; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is
        a business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
        allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other
        provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (iii) absent a business combination, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public
        shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would
        require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only
        approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. Please see &#8220;<font style="font-style: italic;">-If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share</font>&#8221; and other risk

        of time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. The unexpected loss

        business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination

        organizations to present business combination opportunities to such other organizations rather than to us. Accordingly, if any industry advisors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which
        he has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he will honor those obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and

        would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, as a result of their substantial ownership in our company, our initial stockholders may exert
        a substantial influence on other actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of major corporate transactions. If
        our initial stockholders purchase any additional shares of common stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their influence over these actions. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will exert significant
        influence over actions requiring a stockholder vote. Please see Item 1.&#160; Business<font style="font-style: italic;">-&#8220;Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities</font>.&#8221;</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate our initial business combination (unless required by Nasdaq) and thus may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the
        DGCL, which requires an annual meeting of stockholders be held for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with a company&#8217;s bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders
        want us to hold an annual meeting prior to our consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.
        Until we hold an annual meeting of stockholders, public stockholders may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management. In addition, prior to our business combination (a) as holders of our Class A common stock, our
        public stockholders will not have the right to vote on the appointment of our directors and (b) holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock may remove a member of our board of directors for any reason.</div>

        state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a &#8220;cashless basis&#8221; and potentially causing
        such warrants to expire worthless.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are not registering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the
        warrant agreement, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC, and within 60
        business days following our initial business combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus
        relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set
        forth in such registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants
        are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of shares of our Class A common stock that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be
        based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 shares of Class A common stock per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to
        issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is
        available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a &#8220;covered security&#8221; under Section 18(b)(1) of the
        Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a &#8220;cashless basis&#8221; in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to
        file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required
        to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption
        is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may
        have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units. There may be a
        circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants. In such an instance, our sponsor
        and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the shares of Class A common stock underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to
        exercise their warrants and sell the underlying shares of Class A common stock. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of Class A
        common stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Pursuant to a registration rights agreement between us and our initial stockholders, at or after the time of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted
        transferees can demand that we register the resale of their founder shares after those shares convert to shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, our sponsor and its permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the
        private placement warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants, and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register the resale
        of such warrants or the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public
        market <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg28"></a>may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or
        difficult to complete. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A common
        stock that is expected when the common stock owned by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants or warrants issued in connection with working capital loans are registered for resale.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that (a) the
        terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants
        and the warrant agreement set forth in this prospectus, or defective provision or (ii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem
        necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants and (b) all other modifications or amendments require the vote or written consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding
        public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the then outstanding private
        placement warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of
        the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants

        shares of Class A common stock based on the redemption date and the &#8220;fair market value&#8221; of our Class A common stock except as otherwise described in the warrant agreement. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption
        described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are &#8220;out-of-the-money,&#8221; in which case you would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the Class A common stock had your

        combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have issued warrants to purchase 14,575,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share (subject to adjustment), as part of the units sold in our initial public
        offering and sale of private placement warrants. Our initial stockholders currently hold 4,312,500 founder shares. The founder shares are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In addition, if
        our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors make any working capital loans, up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be converted into warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to
        the private placement warrants.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">To the extent we issue shares of Class A common stock to effectuate our initial business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common
        stock upon exercise of these warrants or conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and reduce the value
        of the Class A common stock issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our warrants and founder shares may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in our IPO except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees: (1) they will
        not be redeemable by us (except as in limited circumstances described in the warrant agreement); (2) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred,
        assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; (3) they may <a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg31"></a>be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4) the holders thereof
        (including with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Because each unit contains one-half of one redeemable warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Each unit contains one-half of one redeemable warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. This
        is different from other blank check companies whose units include one share of Class A common stock and one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive
        effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for half of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making
        us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The exercise price for the public warrants is higher than in some other blank check companies, and, accordingly, the warrants are more likely to expire worthless.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The exercise price of the public warrants is higher than in some other blank check companies. For example, historically, the exercise price of a warrant was often a fraction of the purchase price
        of the units in the initial public offering. The exercise price for our public warrants is $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments as provided herein. As a result, the warrants are less likely to ever be in the money and more likely to expire
        worthless.</div>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;">General Risk Factors</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">There is currently no market for our securities. Stockholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision. The price of our
        securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a
        significant outbreak of other infectious diseases). Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established
        and sustained.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure
        requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
        are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
        obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
        payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that
        status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of any second quarter of a fiscal year, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the
        end of such fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions,
        the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;"><a name="nt10017953x3_s1a_104-risk_pg32"></a>Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
        standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised
        financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is
        irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can
        adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth
        company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Additionally, we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations,
        including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates
        equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year&#8217;s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals
        or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year&#8217;s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or
        impossible.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial business combination, require substantial financial and
        management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022.
        Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation
        requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a
        target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such
        entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay
        in the future for our Class A common stock and could entrench management.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These
        provisions include two-year director terms and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that
        otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and
        may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Since only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, Nasdaq may consider us to be a &#8220;controlled company&#8221; within the meaning of
        the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be
        the sole and exclusive forum for any (1) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (2) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee of our company to our company or
        our stockholders, (3) action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer of our company arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (4) action
        asserting a claim against us or any director or officer of our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine except for, as to each of (1) through (4) above, any claim (a) as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an
        indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination) or (b) which is vested in
        the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. The provisions of this paragraph will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability
        or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise arising under federal securities laws, for which the federal district courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or
        otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If any action the subject matter of which
        is within the scope the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a &#8220;foreign action&#8221;) in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal
        jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an &#8220;enforcement action&#8221;), and (y) having service of process made upon such
        stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder&#8217;s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. This forum selection clause may discourage claims or limit stockholders&#8217; ability to submit claims in a
        judicial forum that they find favorable and may result in additional costs for a stockholder seeking to bring a claim. While we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce this forum selection clause is low, if a court were to determine the
        forum selection clause to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction, which could have a negative impact on our results of
        operations and financial condition and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in
        the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial
        business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further,
        if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On February 19, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of our IPO, we completed the private sale, pursuant to an exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, of an aggregate of
        5,950,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, to our sponsor and certain directors and advisors of the Company, at a price of $1.00 per private
        placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,950,000. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in our IPO except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees: (1)
        they will not be redeemable by us (except in certain redemption scenarios when the price per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 (as adjusted); (2) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these
        warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4)
        the holders thereof (including with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights.</div>

        Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one public share at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,950,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable
        to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, to our sponsor and certain directors and advisors of the Company, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant. Only whole warrants are exercisable.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated served as underwriter for our IPO. The units sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We received gross proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants of $172,500,000 and $5,950,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $178,450,000. $172,500,000 of the gross
        proceeds from the IPO and private placement (which includes the underwriter&#8217;s deferred discount of $6,037,500) were deposited in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company as trustee. As of the closing of our IPO, $5,950,000
        was held outside of the trust account, of which $3,450,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions, $796,711 was used to pay other offering costs, and $49,958 was used to repay a note payable to our sponsor. The balance of $1,653,331
        held outside of the trust account is reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. The funds in the trust account
        will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000;">Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be
        released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
        certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
        combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not
        completed our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority
        over the claims of our public stockholders.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for our IPO
        which was consummated on February 19, 2021. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents in
        the form of specified U.S. government treasury bills or specified money market funds. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for
        due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of our IPO.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">For the period from December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $567, which consisted of formation and operating costs.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Liquidity and Capital Resources</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $153,938 in cash and working capital deficit of $384,292 (excluding deferred offering costs). Prior to our IPO, our liquidity needs were satisfied <font style="color: #000000;">through a capital contribution from the sponsor of $25,000 from the sale of the founder shares and up to $300,000 in loans from our sponsor under an unsecured promissory note.</font></div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On February 19, 2021, we consummated our IPO offering 17,250,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant.
        Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one public share at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,950,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable
        to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, to our sponsor and certain directors and advisors of the Company, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We received gross proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants of $172,500,000 and $5,950,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $178,450,000. $172,500,000 of the gross
        proceeds from the IPO and private placement (which includes the underwriter&#8217;s deferred discount of $6,037,500) were deposited in a trust account with <font style="color: #000000;">Continental</font> Stock Transfer and Trust Company as trustee. As
        of the closing of our IPO, $5,950,000 was held outside of the trust account, of which $3,450,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions, $796,711 was used to pay other offering costs, and $49,958 was used to repay a note payable to
        our sponsor. The balance of $1,653,331 held outside of the trust account is reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative
        expenses. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and
        excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. Delaware franchise tax is based on our authorized shares or on our assumed par and non-par capital, whichever yields a
        lower result. Under the authorized shares method, each share is taxed at a graduated rate based on the number of authorized shares with a maximum aggregate tax of $200,000 per year. Our annual franchise tax obligation is expected to be capped at
        the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation of $200,000. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. We expect
        the only taxes payable by us out of the funds in the trust account will be income and franchise taxes. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes. To the extent that our capital stock or
        debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make
        other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;"><a name="nt10017953x8_424b4_107-mda_pg3"></a>As of March 30, 2021, we have available to us approximately $1,653,331 of proceeds held outside the trust account. We believe that such sources of
        liquidity are adequate to fund our operations for the next 12 months and beyond. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the
        offices or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to
        pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes. <a name="z_Hlk67757150"></a>We do not expect to have any capital expenditures during 2021, except as may be incurred in connection with our
        initial business combination (if any).</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not
        obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our initial business combination does not
        close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants
        at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans by our sponsor or our officers and directors, if
        any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing
        to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $360,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses in connection with any business
        combinations; $416,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $58,000 for the Nasdaq continued listing fees; $48,000 for office space, administrative and support services; $100,000 as a reserve for liquidation
        expenses; and approximately $118,000 for working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses (including taxes net of anticipated interest income).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees
        to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a &#8220;no-shop&#8221; provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from &#8220;shopping&#8221; around for
        transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement
        where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a &#8220;no-shop&#8221; provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount
        of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, a prospective
        target businesses.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following our IPO in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of
        identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our
        initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial
        business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities (which may include a specified future issuance) or incur debt in connection with such business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Critical Accounting Estimates</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company&#8217;s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
        disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least
        reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due
        to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual
        Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to
        our management, including the co-chief executive officers and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our co-chief executive officers and
        chief financial officer (our &#8220;Certifying Officers&#8221;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers
        concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
        provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
        benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our
        control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in

        be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation
        committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a nominating and governance committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule
        5605(e)(2) of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by our board of directors. Our board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the
        responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the
        next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for
        director, our board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our
        stockholders. Prior to our initial business combination, holders of our Class A common stock will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board of directors.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct, or our Code of Ethics, applicable to our directors, officers and employees, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. Any
        amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K. In addition, a copy of our Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request to us in writing at 2200 S. Utica, Suite

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to
        which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or
        more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such
        entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us (including as described in &#8220;Item 1. Business <font style="font-style: italic;">&#8212;Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets</font>&#8221;). These conflicts
        may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. James Carney, a significant investor in our sponsor, is not a member of our management or one of our directors and,
        other than serving as an Industry Advisor, does not intend to be actively involved in our business. He will not have any duty to dedicate a particular amount of time or effort to helping us find a business combination target. He will also be
        subject to conflicts of interest described below and in &#8220;Item 1. Business <font style="font-style: italic;">&#8212; Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets</font>.&#8221;</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business
        combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or
        her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business
        combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent
        accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In addition, our sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in the company in connection with the initial business combination through a specified future issuance or
        otherwise, although our sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation or current intention to do so. If our sponsor or any of its affiliates elects to make additional investments, such proposed investments could influence our sponsor&#8217;s motivation
        to complete an initial business combination.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to vote any founder shares and any
        public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination, and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote public shares purchased by them in favor of our initial business combination.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in
        the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except
        to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of
        incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to maintain insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have
        obtained a policy of directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our
        officers and directors.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">We have adopted a Code of Ethics requiring us to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved by our board of directors (or the appropriate
        committee of our board of directors) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our Code of Ethics, conflict of interest situations will include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or
        guarantee of indebtedness) involving the company.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In addition, our audit committee, pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter into such transactions.
        An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will
        constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were
        made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or any of their affiliates.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee
        or officer.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">On December 11, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 3,593,750 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, resulting in an effective purchase price per share
        of approximately $0.007. In February 2021, our sponsor sold 10,000 founder shares to each of Sashi Brown, Endre Holen, Joyce C. Johnson and Sebastian Park, our independent directors (for a total of 40,000 founder shares), for an aggregate purchase
        price of $69.57, resulting in an effective purchase price per share of approximately $0.007. In February 2021, our sponsor sold 2,500 founder shares to each of R.C. Buford, Art Chou and Hugh Forrest (for a total of 7,500 founder shares), for an
        aggregate purchase price of $17.39, resulting in an effective purchase price per share of approximately $0.007. On February 16, 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 718,750 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial
        stockholders holding an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares (up to 562,500 of which are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriter&#8217;s option to purchase additional units is exercised).</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">Simultaneously with the consummation of our IPO on February 19, 2021, our sponsor, Mr. Brown, Mr. Buford, Mr. Chou, Mr. Forrest, Mr. Holen, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Park purchased an
        aggregate of 5,950,000 private placement warrants for a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant, at an aggregate value of $5,950,000. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of
        $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred,
        assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">We entered into an Administrative Services Agreement on February 16, 2021 pursuant to which we will also pay our sponsor a total of $2,000 per month for office space, administrative
        and support services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Accordingly, in the event the consummation of our initial business combination takes the maximum 24 months, our
        sponsor will be paid a total of $48,000 ($2,000 per month) for office space, administrative and support services and will be entitled to be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">Our sponsor, officers and directors or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such
        as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or any of
        their respective affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on
        our behalf.</div>
      <div><br>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Promissory Note</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt;"><font style="color: #000000;">On December 18, 2020, our sponsor agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of our IPO. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured
          and was due at the earlier of April 30, 2021 and the closing of our IPO. </font>As of December 31, 2020, we had drawn down $176,000 under the promissory note. On February 22, 2021, the Company paid the balance on the note in full.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Working Capital Loans</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or our officers and
        directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our initial
        business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may
        be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans by our sponsor or
        our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe
        third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us, if any, may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with
        any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known
        at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine
        executive officer and director compensation.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000;">We entered into a letter agreement with our initial stockholders, officers and directors on February 16, 2021 pursuant to which (x) they have agreed to waive: (1) their redemption
        rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them, as applicable, in connection with the completion of our initial business combination; (2) their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by
        them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our initial business
        combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial
        business combination activity; and (3) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our
        IPO or during any extension period (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
        frame), and (y) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions.&#8221;</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;"><font style="color: #000000;">Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 16, 2021, the holders of the founder </font>shares, private placement warrants and warrants that
        may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the working capital loans and upon conversion of the founder
        shares) are entitled to registration rights requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion to shares of Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to
        three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain &#8220;piggy-back&#8221; registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our
        initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not be required to effect or permit any
        registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions.&#160; We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration
        statements.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The rules of Nasdaq require that a majority of our board of directors be independent within one year of our IPO. An &#8220;independent director&#8221; is defined generally as a person other than an officer or
        employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company&#8217;s board of directors, would interfere with the director&#8217;s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the
        responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that each of Sashi Brown, Endre Holen, Joyce C. Johnson and Sebastian Park is an independent director under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. Our independent directors will have
        regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Timothy W. Clark, C. Tavo Hellmund and Jeffrey Luhnow are not independent directors under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules due to their service as officers.<br>

        regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by Withum for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements for period from&#160; December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 was $73,645. The above amounts
        include audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported
        under &#8220;Audit Fees.&#8221; These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We did not pay Withum for consultations concerning financial
        accounting and reporting standards for the period from&#160; December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Our audit committee was formed subsequent to December 31, 2020 but prior to the consummation of our IPO. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although
        any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved or ratified by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all
        auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the
        audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of SportsTek Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder&#8217;s equity and cash flows for
        the period from December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
        position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
        United States of America.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
        registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
        the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
        material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of
        internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
        included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
        the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">SportsTek Acquisition Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 7, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting
        a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (&#8220;Business Combination&#8221;). The Company has not identified any potential business combination target and
        it has not, nor has anyone on its behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target with respect to the Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth
        company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">As of December 31, 2020, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 relates to the Company&#8217;s formation and
        preparation for the Initial Public Offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) as described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
        income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO as described below.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company&#8217;s sponsor is JTJT Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;).&#160; Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the registration statement for the Company&#8217;s IPO was declared
        effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on February 16, 2021 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;). On February 19, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 17,250,000 units (the &#8220;Units&#8221; and, with respect to the shares of Class A
        common stock included in the Units, the &#8220;Public Shares&#8221; and the warrants included in the Units, the &#8220;Public Warrants&#8221;), which included the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 2,250,000 Units, at
        $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000, which is discussed in Note 3.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 5,950,000 warrants (the &#8220;Private Warrants&#8221;), at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, which is discussed in Note 4.
        Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, generating gross proceeds of $5,950,000, which is described in Note 4.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Transaction costs of the IPO amounted to $10,284,211 consisting of $3,450,000 of underwriting discount, $6,037,500 of deferred underwriting discount, and $796,711 of other offering costs (see Note
        8).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Following the closing of the IPO on February 19, 2021, $172,500,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO, including the proceeds from the sale of the Private
        Placement Warrants, was deposited in a trust account (&#8220;Trust Account&#8221;) <font style="color: #000000;">located in the United States and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market

          the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the Company&#8217;s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company has not consummated
          a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (iii) the redemption of any Public Shares if the

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the &#8220;Public Stockholders&#8221;) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a
        Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination
        or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share).
        There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company&#8217;s warrants.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The shares of common stock subject to redemption was recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Accounting Standards
        Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 480 &#8220;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&#8221; In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business
        Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted of common stock are voted in favor of the Business Combination</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company will have only 24 months from February 19, 2021, the closing of the IPO, to complete an initial Business Combination (the &#8220;Combination Period&#8221;). However, if the Company doesn&#8217;t complete
        a Business Combination within the Combination Period, <font style="color: #000000;"> the Company will redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, equal to the aggregate amount then on
          deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to
          applicable law and as further described in registration statement, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate</font>.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company&#8217;s Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive (i) their redemption rights with respect to any
        Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote
        to approve an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of the Company&#8217;s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the
        Company has not consummated a Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the IPO or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public
        registered accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below
        (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest
        which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company&#8217;s indemnity of the underwriter of the IPO
        against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be
        responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service
        providers (except for the Company&#8217;s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of
        any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. However, the Company has not asked its Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether its Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its
        indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Company&#8217;s Sponsor&#8217;s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure that its Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Liquidity and Capital Resources</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $153,938 in cash and working capital deficit of $384,292 (excluding deferred offering costs). <font style="color: #000000;">The Company&#8217;s liquidity needs
          up to December 31, 2020 had been satisfied through a capital contribution from the Sponsor of $25,000 (see Note 5) for the founder shares and the loan under an unsecured promissory note from the Sponsor of $176,000 (see Note 5).</font></div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Subsequent to December 31, 2020, on February 19, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 17,250,000 Units generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000 (see Note 8).&#160; <font style="color: #000000;">As
          of February 19, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.9 million in its operating bank account, and working capital of approximately $1.7 million</font>.&#160; <font style="color: #000000;">In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in
          connection with a Business Combination, the Company&#8217;s Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company&#8217;s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined and described in
          Note 5). To date, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans</font>.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business
        Combination or one year from this filing. </div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Risks and Uncertainties</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Management is continuing to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that it could have a negative effect on the Company&#8217;s financial
        position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
        outcome of this uncertainty.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Note 2 &#8212; Significant Accounting Policies</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Basis of Presentation</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;US GAAP&#8221;) and pursuant to the rules and regulations
        of the SEC.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Emerging Growth Company Status</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company is an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;), and it may take
        advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
        requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on
        executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those
        that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act
        provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of
        such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the
        time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&#8217;s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of
        using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Use of Estimates</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
        contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment.&#160; It is at least reasonably possible
        that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future
        confirming events.&#160; Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.</div>

      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Cash and Cash Equivalents</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of
        December 31, 2020.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Deferred Offering Costs</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Deferred offering costs consist of legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the IPO and that were charged to stockholders&#8217; equity
        upon the completion of the IPO.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Fair Value of Financial Instruments</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The fair value of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Net Loss Per Common Stock</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding during the period, excluding common stock subject to
        forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 562,500 shares of common stock that were subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option was not exercised by the underwriters (see Note 5). <font style="color: #000000;">As a result of the underwriter&#8217;s election to partially exercise their over-allotment option on February 19, 2021, the 562,500 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture (see Note 8). </font> At December 31, 2020, the Company
        did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per
        common share for the period presented.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Income Taxes</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 Income Taxes (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences
        between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it
        is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.&#160; The deferred tax assets were deemed to be immaterial as of December 31, 2020.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#8217;s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial
        statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740
        also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and
        penalties as of December 31, 2020. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company has identified the United States as its only
        &#8220;major&#8221; tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax
        jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company&#8217;s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. The provision for income taxes was deemed
        to be immaterial for the period from December 7, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Note 3 &#8212; Initial Public Offering</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On February 19, 2021, the Company sold 17,250,000 at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional
        2,250,000 Units (see Note 8). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per
        share, subject to adjustment. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the initial Business
        Combination or 12 months from the closing of the IPO and will expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation (see Note 7).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Note 4 &#8212; Private Placement</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Sponsor and certain of the Company&#8217;s directors and advisors purchased an aggregate of 5,950,000 Private Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private
        Warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,950,000, in a private placement. A portion of the proceeds from the private placement was added to the proceeds from the IPO held in the Trust Account (see Note 8).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the IPO, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable
        upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants
        will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable, except as described above, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its
        permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="font-weight: bold;">Founder Shares</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On December 11, 2020, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration for 3,593,750 shares of Class B common stock (the &#8220;Founder Shares&#8221;). <a name="z_Hlk67003302"></a>On February 16, 2021 the Company effected a stock dividend of 718,750 shares with respect to the Class B common stock, resulting in the initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 4,312,500 Founder Shares (See Note 8).
        The accompanying financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend in the share capitalization.&#160; The Founder Shares include an aggregate of up to 562,500 shares subject to forfeiture if the option to purchase
        additional units is not exercised by the underwriter in full. On February 19, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option, hence, the 562,500 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture (see Note 8).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of a Business
        Combination and (ii) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations
        and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar
        transaction that results in all of the Public Stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">On December 18, 2020, Company issued an unsecured promissory note to the Sponsor for an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the IPO. This loan is non-interest bearing and
        payable on the earlier of April 30, 2021 or the completion of the IPO. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has drawn down $176,000 under the promissory note. On February 22, 2021, the Company paid the balance on the note (see Note 8).</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or certain of the Company&#8217;s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds
        as may be required (&#8220;Working Capital Loans&#8221;). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender&#8217;s discretion, up to $2,000,000
        of the notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the
        Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts
        outstanding under the Working Capital Loans.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Commencing on the date of the IPO, the Company will reimburse its Sponsor for office space, administrative and support services provided to members of the Company&#8217;s management team in an amount not
        to exceed $2,000 per month. Upon completion of the Company&#8217;s Business Combination or its liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of
        the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated February 16, 2021,
        requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to shares of Class A common stock). The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short
        form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain &#8220;piggy-back&#8221; registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights
        to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any
        registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.</div>

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The underwriter had a 45-day option from the date of the IPO on February 19, 2021 to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,250,000 additional Units at the public offering price less the underwriting
        commissions to cover over-allotments, if any. On February 19, 2021, the <font style="color: #000000;">underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option (see Note 8).</font></div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The underwriter was entitled to a cash underwriting fee of $0.20 per Unit payable upon the closing of the IPO. When the IPO closed on February 19, 2021, the underwriter was paid an aggregate of
        $3,450,000, or $0.20 per Unit.</div>

        share. As of December 31, 2020, there were 3,593,750 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. On February 16, the Company effected a stock dividend of 718,750 shares with respect to the Class B common stock, resulting in the initial
        stockholders holding an aggregate of 4,312,500 Founder Shares (see Note 8). &#160;The accompanying financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock dividend. The Founders Shares include an aggregate of up to 562,500 shares of
        Class B common stock were subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriter&#8217;s option to purchase additional units was not exercised in full. On February 19, 2021, the underwriter fully exercised its over-allotment option, hence, the 562,500
        Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture (see Note 8).</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">Only holders of the Class B common stock will have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A common stock and holders of Class B common

      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis,
        subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the IPO and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio
        at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any
        such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all shares of
        common stock outstanding upon the completion of the IPO plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (net of the number of shares of Class A common stock
        redeemed in connection with a Business Combination), excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller in a Business Combination.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Warrants </font>&#8212; Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock at a price of
        $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Class A common stock. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and
        only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the IPO. The Public Warrants will expire five years after
        the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 18pt;">The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a
        registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock is
        available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to
        issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from

        prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange
        such that it satisfies the definition of a &#8220;covered security&#8221; under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a &#8220;cashless basis&#8221; in accordance
        with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
